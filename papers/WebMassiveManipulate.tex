\begin{abstract}
Micro- and nanorobotics have the potential to revolutionize many applications including targeted material delivery, assembly, and surgery.  The same properties that promise breakthrough solutions---small size and large populations---present unique challenges to generating controlled motion. We want to use large swarms of robots to perform manipulation tasks; unfortunately, human-swarm interaction studies as conducted today are limited in sample size, are difficult to reproduce, and are prone to hardware failures. We present an alternative.

This paper examines the perils, pitfalls, and possibilities we discovered by launching \href{http://www.swarmcontrol.net}{SwarmControl.net}, an online game where players steer swarms of up to 500 robots to complete manipulation challenges. We record statistics from thousands of players, and use the game to explore aspects of large-population robot control. We present the game framework as a new, open-source tool for large-scale user experiments. Our results have potential applications in human control of micro- and nanorobots, supply insight for automatic controllers, and provide a template for large online robotic research experiments.


%{The introduction tells us the contribution here.  What did we learn?}
  
% Control of multi-robot systems with large populations is in its infancy, and would benefit from detailed user experiments.  Such experiments could help select the best control architectures and level of feedback and lead ultimately to efficient automatic controllers.
% Unfortunately, large-scale user experiments have been prohibitively expensive.
   
%We present a survey of several control techniques for directing swarms,
%and compare their efficacy under several different task scenarios. The
%control rules used are either control strategies in the global frame,
%strategies which depend on user input and function in a local frame, or
%hybrid strategies that take into account both global frames and swarm state
%These rules are tested for their utility in swarm positioning, in manipulating
%objects through a maze, and in assembling objects.
