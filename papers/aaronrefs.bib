	Abstract = {The feasibility for in vivo navigation of untethered devices or robots is demonstrated with the control and tracking of a 1.5 mm diameter ferromagnetic bead in the carotid artery of a living swine using a clinical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) platform. Navigation is achieved by inducing displacement forces from the three orthogonal slice selection and signal encoding gradient coils of a standard MRI system. The proposed method performs automatic tracking, propulsion, and computer control sequences at a sufficient rate to allow navigation along preplanned paths in the blood circulatory system. This technique expands the range of applications in MRI-based interventions.},

	Abstract = {A magnetic resonance (MR) compatible surgical assist robot
system under preclinical evaluation is described. It is designed to coexist,
and cooperate, with a surgeon, and to position and direct an axisymmetric
tool, such as a laser pointer or a biopsy catheter. The main mechanical
body is located above the head of the surgeon, and two rigid arms extend
to the workspace. This configuration contributes to a small occupancy
in the surgeon's workspace, and good MR compatibility.
The design of the robot is described. The MR compatibility is examined,
and shows that there is no adverse effect on the imaging, even when
the robot is in motion. Any heating effect was not evaluated, because a
published study has revealed any effect is quite small. This robot system
is carefully designed for safety and sterilization issues.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a general theory for the fields generated by a circular current loop and compares it with existing theories. The existing, general, closed solution for the vector magnetic field may be expressed in a number of seemingly different but equivalent forms. These relations offer alternative closed-form solutions that may find various applications, including the characterization of Helmholtz coils. The paper provides alternative closed forms in both spherical and cylindrical coordinate systems. It employs Gauss's magnetic law to show that the alternative closed form is self-consistent and correct and also shows agreement with well-known solutions. Finally, it develops a new (or not readily found) tabulated mathematical identity.},

	Abstract = {Cognitive radio is viewed as a novel approach for improving the utilization of a precious natural resource: the radio electromagnetic spectrum. The cognitive radio, built on a software-defined radio, is defined as an intelligent wireless communication system that is aware of its environment and uses the methodology of understanding-by-building to learn from the environment and adapt to statistical variations in the input stimuli, with two primary objectives in mind: · highly reliable communication whenever and wherever needed; · efficient utilization of the radio spectrum. Following the discussion of interference temperature as a new metric for the quantification and management of interference, the paper addresses three fundamental cognitive tasks. 1) Radio-scene analysis. 2) Channel-state estimation and predictive modeling. 3) Transmit-power control and dynamic spectrum management. This work also discusses the emergent behavior of cognitive radio.},

	Abstract = {Reduced field-of-view (FOV) acceleration using time-adaptive sensitivity encoding (TSENSE) or unaliasing by Fourier encoding the overlaps using the temporal dimension (UNFOLD) can improve the depiction of motion in real-time MRI. However, increased computational resources are required to maintain a high frame rate and low latency in image reconstruction and display. A high-performance software system has been implemented to perform TSENSE and UNFOLD reconstructions for real-time MRI with interactive, on-line display. Images were displayed in the scanner room to investigate image-guided procedures. Examples are shown for normal volunteers and cardiac interventional experiments in animals using a steady-state free precession (SSFP) sequence. In order to maintain adequate image quality for interventional procedures, the imaging rate was limited to seven frames per second after an acceleration factor of 2 with a voxel size of 1.8 × 3.5 × 8 mm. Initial experiences suggest that TSENSE and UNFOLD can each improve the compromise between spatial and temporal resolution in real-time imaging, and can function well in interactive imaging. UNFOLD places no additional constraints on receiver coils, and is therefore more flexible than SENSE methods; however, the temporal image filtering can blur motion and reduce the effective acceleration. Methods are proposed to overcome the challenges presented by the use of TSENSE in interactive imaging. TSENSE may be temporarily disabled after changing the imaging plane to avoid transient artifacts as the sensitivity coefficients adapt. For imaging with a combination of surface and interventional coils, a hybrid reconstruction approach is proposed whereby UNFOLD is used for the interventional coils, and TSENSE with or without UNFOLD is used for the surface coils.},

	Abstract = {Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) guided
nanorobotic systems that could perform diagnostic, curative
and reconstructive treatments in the human body at the
cellular and sub-cellular level in a controllable manner have
recently been proposed. The concept of a MRI-guided
nanorobotic system is based on the use of a MRI scanner to
induce the required external driving forces to guide magnetic
nanocapsules to a specific target. However, the maximum
magnetic gradient specifications of existing clinical MRI
systems are not capable of driving superparamagnetic
nanocapsules against the blood flow and therefore these MRIs
do not allow for navigation. The present paper proposes a way
to overcome this critical drawback through the formation of
micron size agglomerations where their size can be regulated
by external magnetic stimuli. This approach is investigated
through modeling of the physics that govern the self-assembly
of the nanoparticles. Additionally a computational tool has
been developed that incorporates the derived models and
performs simulation, visualization and post-processing analysis.
Preliminary simulation results demonstrate that external
magnetic field causes aggregation of nanoparticles while they
flow in the vessel. This is a promising result -in accordance with
similar experimental results- and encourages further
investigation on the nanoparticle based self-assembly structures
for use in nanorobotic drug delivery.},

Bush's machine, which used a mathematical method different from that of Babbage's Difference Enginer, was full of shafts, wires, wheels, pulley's, and 1,000 gears that appeared to be the work of overzealous elves rather than an efflugent scientist.  Everything was driven by small electric motors that had to be carefully adjusted for accuracy of calculations.  The Differential analyzer had to run at slow speeds, because disks could slip and thow numbers off.

	Abstract = {In this paper we investigate control of a large swarm of mobile particles (such as robots, sensors, or building material) that move in a 2D workspace using a global input signal, e.g., provided by gravity or a magnetic field. Upon activation, each robot moves in the same direction, maximally until it hits a stationary obstacle or another stationary robot.
In a workspace with only simple exterior boundaries, this system model is
of limited use because it has only two controllable degrees of freedom---all
robots receive the same inputs and move uniformly. We show that adding a
maze of obstacles to the environment can make the system drastically more complex and more useful.

We prove that it is NP-hard to decide whether a given initial configuration can
be transformed into a desired target configuration, if we are given a fixed set of stationary obstacles. On the positive side, we provide constructive algorithms to design workspaces that efficiently implement arbitrary permutations between different configurations.},

CONGREVE'S SPECIFICATION.

To all to whom these presents shall come, I, William Congreve, of Garden Court, in the Temple, in the County of Middlesex, Esquire, send greeting.

Whereas His most Excellent Majesty King George the Third did, by His Letters Patent under the Great Seal of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, bearing the date at Westminster, the Twenty-fourth day of August, in the forty-eighth year of His reign, give and grant unto me, the said William Congreve, my executors, administrators, and assigns, His especial license, full power, sole privilege and authority, that I, the said William Congreve, my executors, administrators, and assigns, during the term of years therein mentioned, should and lawfully might make, use, exercise, and vend, within England, Wales, and the Town of Berwick-upon-Tweed, my Invention of "A New Principle of Measuring Time and Constructing Clocks and Chronometers;" in which said Letters Patent there is contained a proviso obliging me, the said William Congreve, by an instrument in writing under my hand and seal, to cause a particular description of the nature of my said Invention, and in what manner the same is to be performed, to be inrolled in His Majesty's High Court of Chancery within one calendar month after the date of the said recited Letters Patent, as in and by the same (relation being therunto had) may more fully and at large appear.

Now know ye, that in compliance with the said proviso, I, the said William Congreve, do declare that my said Invention is described in manner following (that is to say):-

The new principle or system of measuring time and constructing clocks and chronometers, which is the basis of this Patent, is founded on certain modes herein-after specified, of detaching the time measurer from the first mover for an extent of duration far beyond anything ever yet effected or proposed, and which is not confied within the limits of ordinary detachments. Thus the only detachments hitherto effected have either been limited to a period somewhat less than the smallest portion of time indicated by the vibrations of their time measurer, and have therefore seldom been extended beyond seconds, or they have been effected by the intervention of an auxiliary power between the first mover and the time measurer, which indeed ought scarcely to be considered as falling within the class of detached movements, as the time measurer, when discharged from the maintaining power, is in this case still combined with another force. But by the system here specified the duration of the detachment of the time measurer from the first mover may, without the intervention of any intermediate power, be extended to a period comprehending any number of the smaller portions of time indicated by the time measurer; in other words, the time measurer shall indicate seconds or any smaller division, and yet it shall be absolutely detached from the maintaining power for a period of one or more minutes. This, therefore, gives a most distinct and definable character to this new mode of measuring time, the leading property of which is a new and extremely extended detachment, and which I have therefore denominated the "mode of extreme detachment."

Before I proceed, however, to the several plans for effecting it, I shall briefly state its principle advantages. The great difficulty of combining the actions of the regulating principle of clocks with the maintaining power, so that the regulating organ whall be operated upon freely and uniformly by the action of gravity, whether accelerated or retarded by the non-accordance of the first mover, has long since pointed out that the only true system of effecting this desideratum was by detaching them as much as possible rather than by combination with the ordinary regulators, that is to say, with the common pendulum or balance wheel. The extent of this principle of detachment, as already observed, is extremely limited; for as, with the most perfect detached escapement in use, the maintaining power is allowed to act on the pendulum for a certain portion of every oscillation, it follows that with the common pendulum it would be extremely inconvenient to detach the first power for an interval much longer than a second, in so high a law to the lengths of pendulums increase as their times, so that to obtain a detachment of 2" would require a pendulum of 13 feet 0.512 inches in length; to obtain one of a minute would require no less a length than 11738 feet 4.800 inches. The first, therefore, which would still be very limited as to any important correction in its effect, would be of a most inconvenient, and the latter of an impossible, length. By adopting the mode of this Patent, however, it will be found that such, or even a greater, extension of detachment than a minute is practicable without any difficulty or inconvenience whatever, and even in a smaller space than is required for the common seconds clock. The next general advantage is, that a clock made on the principle of extreme detachment requires much less first power than a common clock, for the power of the former may be organized so as to rest altogether for intervals of minutes, and to be limited when in action to less than half seconds between those intervals, while that of the latter is constantly exerted every second; nevertheless the maintaining power of the former need not have more to perform every minute than the other has every second. It follows, therefore, that a clock may be constructed on this principle to require only one sixtieth of the weight or power of a common clock, or, that with the same power, it will go sixty times as long. Again, the mode of extreme detachment, by diminishing the quantity of the first force to so great a degree, and by the constant state of repose which it preserves in the train of the clock, removes almost entirely the strain and friction to which the works of a common clock are subject, so that the wear of the patent clock becomes next to nothing, and it can therefore scarcely ever require the application of oil, or get out of order. So also this system of detachment will be found greatly to simplify the train; in fact, the greater the extent of the detachment the more simple will it be by working from minutes or other longer times instead of seconds; notwithstanding which, however, the second or any less division of time, may be indicated with as much accuracy as in the more complicated train of the common timepiece. Such then are the general advantages of this Patent, and whether they be viewed with reference to the extent of the detachment or the diminution of the maintaining power required, or the simplification of the train, I conceive that no further discussion of the principle is necessary with those who are at all conversant with the principles of timekeeping, to convince them that the attainment of these points is of the utmost importance to the final perfection of a true measure of time.

I shall therefore now proceed to the Specification of the plan which I have practised for their accomplishment. And here I have introduced a new modification of the action of gravity as applied to timekeeping, by taking, as the time measurer, "a perfectly detached body descending freely down an inclined plane;" which modification, although it has never yet been applied to the measurement of time, is as immutable in its operation as the oscillations of a pendulum, and is, in fact, governed by the same law; the extreme detachment of which it is capable, and certain specific advantages which the pendulum does not possess, have pointed it out to me as an important agent in the measurement of time. The following are several different modes in which I have applied this new regulating organ for the accomplishment of this Patent: -

Figure 1:


Figure 2:


Fig. 1 and 2 shew the dial and frame plate of an eight-day spring clock, having a small tube a, b, six inches long, containing a steel ball. This tube and ball serve the purpose of a pendulum 7 feet 4.038 inches in length, making exactly forty beats in a minute. The tube is connected with the train merely by an arbor and pinion, and being a little inclined, the ball runs from a to b, where it discharges by striking against it a small spring detent d that holds the tube in the position a, b, when, being so discharged, the tube makes a half revolution from b to d, and is caught again by the same detent, the ball being thus brought back to the upper end, runs down again, and striking the detent, repeats its half revolution as before. This tube may be in part considered as a revolving pendulum, where the centre of gravity oscillates but the system revolves, and where the time is measured, partly by an oscillation, and partly by the descent of the ball down the plane. The clock is at rest while the ball runs from a to b, that is, two thirds of the whole time; and a tube of six inches, thus producing beats as slow as a common pendulum 7 feet 4.038 inches in length, is consequently in that proportion so much less liable to the expansions or contractions of temperature. All the escapement work is also here avoided, a common steel pinion being substituted for it, the effect of the escapement being produced by the descent of the ball. This property, peculiar to the new regulating organ here required, is undoubtedly a very important one, from the great nicety required in the construction of escapements, and the comparative simplicity of making a common pinion, which here answers all the purpose. The time is regulated by the small hand at C, Fig. 1 and 2, which, by moving the detent d higher or lower, diminishes or increases the inclination of the tube, and with it the time of descent.

[There is no paragraph break in the original document at this point; Figure 3 is inserted at this point in this transcription for ease of reference.]

Figure 3:


Fig. 3 is the face of a clock similar to Fig. 1, but having a small wheel a, b, instead of the tube connected with the train by an axis and pinion as before; this wheel contains a series of inclined planes a, x, y, z, u, b which, being held in a given position by a small spring detent d, as in the former case, the ball unlocks the wheel, and the time is regulated as above. In this application six seconds are consumed in the running of the ball from a to b, and in the shifting of the wheel half round for a fresh run of the ball. This index, therefore, makes ten beats in a minute, or five whole revolutions; and, the wheel not occupying more than half a second in shifting, the first mover and train are at rest eleven-twelfths of the whole time, during which proportion of time the regulating organ is entirely detached from the maintaining power, and thus the detachment is carried to as great an extent as, by means of the best detached escapement hitherto made, it could be made with a common pendulum of 116 feet 8.608 inches in length.

[There is no paragraph break in the original document at this point; Figures 4 and 5 are inserted at this point in this transcription for ease of reference.]

Figure 4:


Figure 5:


Fig. 4 is a clock in which the detachment is carried to a still greater extent. a, b, Fig. 4, is an inclined plane fourteen inches long and eight inches wide, having thirty grooves cut in it, as shewn in plan Fig. 5; along these grooves a small ball runs from a to b, or from c to d, according as the plane is inclined one way or the other. Now this plane is calculated at a certain inclination to give exactly one minute for the time of the ball's motion from one end of it to the other, where, having arrived at the lowest point, it strikes a lever n connected with the detent e, and unlocking it the maintaining power is allowed to act for a moment for the purpose of shifting the plane (which is most accurately balanced on a knife edge) into the position c, d, that the ball may run back again in another minute to the opposite extremeity of the plane, where it again unlocks the same detent by a corresponding lever m connected with it. The velocity of the ball is no greater at the bottom of the plane than at the end of the first groove, for the acceleration required in each groove is destroyed by the small brass deflectors z, z, z, z, &c., Fig. 5, at the end of each groove, which turn the ball into the opposite direction of each succeeding groove; neither is the ball allowed to stop the least instant of time during the shifting of the plane, but is immediately thrown back on its return by the action of a small crooked arm so regulated by its form and pressure as instantly upon the ball's striking the lever to throw it back, and keep it moving on its rturn until the shifting of the plane is completed with the mean velocity of its motion on the plane when so shifted, so that no inequality produced by the first power in the time of the planes shifting can make any variation in the whole time of the ball's motion from one end of the plane to the other, for, whether the plane rises faster or slower, the ball always returns at the same rate without a moment's pause. This correction is indeed almost superfluous, for in the very short and rare action of the maintaining power, during the almost instantatneous shifting of the plane once a minute only, any inequality that can possibly arise with ordinary good workmanship must be next to nothing, and can hardly produce a sensible effect in the longest period of going. It shews, however, that the principle of extreme detachment may in this application be made absolutely perfect, inasmuch as neither the motion of the ball in its progress along the plane, nor at the moment of its departure on its return, is in the least influenced by the first mover; the time of shifting the plane is not so much as half a second, therefore the first power of this clock is at rest, and the whole train in a state of repose more than one hundred and nineteen hundred and twentieths of the whole minute; that is to say, all connection with the moving power is as long suspended as could be effected, on the ordinary principles of detachment, with a pendulum of the enormous and impossible length of 11,783 feet 4.800 inches, which, if it were practicable, would vibrate minutes; yet, notwithstanding this extreme detachment in the patent clock, the smallest portion of the intermediate time may be indicated by the beats of the ball or time measurer, which, as stated at the commencement of this Specification, is the great characteristic of this new mode of detachment. This is effected by a bridge or bridges, &c. f, f, across the plane, under the arches of which the ball passes. The figures indicating the division of time, thus shewn, are made to shift accordingly as the ball runs from right to left or from left to right, so that they may be read off in seconds or smaller divisions with the greatest accuracy, as the motion of the ball is nearly uniform, all acceleration in passing down the plane being destroyed, as already described, at the end of each groove. To explain the remaining parts of this clock, the circle M shews the minutes advancing one every time the plane shifts, and the minutes being driven directly from the moving power P, the circle H shews the hours which are driven from M. R is the regulator, being the means of connection between M, the minute hand, and the plane, which is effected by a crank and rod x, y. Every time, therefore, the ball unlocks the plane, R is allowed to make half a revolution, which gives the time to both minute and hour hands; the circle R therefore is graduated, and has a hand which adjusts the distance of the crank from the centre of the circle, by which adjustment of the inclination of the plane is varied, and with it the time. Thus, in the space of a moderately-sized table clock, a timepiece is constructed, the vibrations of the regulating organ of which are as slow as those of a pendulum 11,738 feet 4.800 inches in length, by which the first power is so reversed that the weight or spring of a common eight-day clock may be made to carry it four hundred and eighty days; neither is there any friction or motion in its train for one hundred and nineteen hundred and twentieths of the whole time of its going, while the train itself is also considerably more simple than that of a common seconds clock.

It is evident that there are innumerable varieties of configuration in the application of this principle, which it is impossible to specify or even to anticipate, but which must nevertheless be integral parts of this Invention, if they in any shape accomplish the mode of measuring time by means of the extreme detachment here specified. To attain this, therefore, it cannot be lawful for any one to make use of any body, whether spherical, cylindrical, or conical, moving on any inclined plane, however the same may be combined with any machinery or clockwork wahtsoever, whether the plane be simple or complex, curvilinear or rectilinear, whether it vibrate or revolve, whether the body moving down it be a simple or compound substance consisting of one or more parts, whether it be a fluid or a solid, or a combination of both. Various modes also may be introduced for the compensation of the expansions and contractions of temperature, either in the detent or in the rod x, y, which it is not necessary here to specify; but it should be observed, that an inherent power of compensation is combined in the very principle itself, for as the plane expands so also does the ball, and vie vers{\^a}; the ball therefore moves quicker as its course is lengthened, and slower as it is shortened, because the vertical distance of the points of contact from the centre of gravity of the ball increases with the expansion and decreases with the contraction of the ball and plane, so as to accelerate the motion of the ball in the first case and retard it in the second. It appears, therefore, that this inherent property may be a due proportioning of the diameter of the ball, and the matter of which it is formed, to the mean length of the plane, and its component materials be so adjusted as of itself to produce a perfect compensation. And lastly, with respect to the workmanship of clocks made on this principle, it appears that less attention to it is required than in common clocks; for as to the train it has so little comparatively to perform, and so little of the measure of time has been shewn to depend upon it, that any want of superior workmanship must be little felt, and for ordinary purposes, therefore, even less than ordinary accuracy must be sufficient. And as to the plane, as any inequality in the surface or irregularity in the first formation of the grooves, must always similarly recur to the ball in every descent, it follows that no such circumstances can destroy its true measure of time; but should any change in the surface of the plane or in the form of the ball take place in a length of time, such change must be for the better, since the edges of the grooves will become more and more even and polished as the ball travels, and the ball will wear itself into the most perfect sphericity, as from its rolling over at the extremity of each groove by means of the deflectors z, z, z, Fig. 5, its axis of motion is constantly varying. It appears, therefore, that no part of the truth of the action of such a clock depends, as is the case with the present system of good timekeepers, upon the exquisite perfection of their workmanship, neither does it depend upon any particularly nice adjustment or preservation of position; for although the clock be placed out of the true level, so that the plane in shifting becomes more inclined one way than the other, still it will be found that what the ball has gained one way it will exactly lose the other, and that therefore the result of every two librations of the plane must (in any position in which the ball will continue its motion both ways) be the true measure of the sum of any two consequent periods of its course, a principle of self-correction which does not exist in common pendulum clocks.

Figure 6:


The next application of this new modification of the power of gravity for the measurement of time which I propose to specify is that in which two balls are used instead of one, as in the cases hitherto explained. A, B, C, Fig. 6, is a wheel attached to the train of the clock by an axis and pinion similar to that in Fig. 3, having three tubes, A, B, B, C, and C, A, and two balls. Suppose the two balls at 1 and 2, then will the wheel oscillate slowly till the balls are brought nearly into the position 2 and 3, by the simple operation of travity, and suppose that at this point the first mover is allowed to act for an instant to throw the wheel a little further round, so that the upper tube becomes in a small degree inclined, that ball will then run to the other extremity, so as to restore the first position 1 and 2, which change will immediately produce another slow and detached movement of the wheel nearly one third round, and this being compleated, as before, the first position will again be assumed. This variation, therefore, though depending upon the action of two balls instead of one, must be considered as another integral part of this Patent, not only because it acts by a similar process, but because it produces the same effect. It cannot therefore be lawful for any one to construct a clock, the time measurer or regulating organ of which shall be constructed by means of this or any similar application of two or any greater number of balls, whether they act by partial revolution or oscillation, or however they may be connected with each other or with the train, and it is evident that no possible application of the descent of any body or bodies fluid or compound down an inclined plane can be made for the purpose of measuring time or of procuring the system herein specified of extreme detachment between powr which must not be a violation of this Patent.

Figure 7:


I shall now therefore proceed to specify the mode by which I accomplish precisely the same system of measuring time by the simple pendulum; that is to say, where, agreeably to the characteristic distinction which pervades this Patent, the duration of the detachment shall not, as by the present system, be limited to the times of vibration, but on the contrary, let a pendulum vibrate half seconds, quarter seconds, or any smaller portion of time, still, like the ball on the inclined plane, it shall be absolutely detached from the first mover for any number of these portions, as a minute or any number of minutes, and this also without the intervention of any intermediate or auxiliary power. Fig. 7. A is a light spring wheel with thirty teeth unconnected with everything but the seconds hand and the small pair of pallets X, Y, which by an inverted action drive the wheel. B, B, is a large swing wheel having sixty teeth connected with a single pallet P on the same stock as those X, Y; P being driven by the wheel B, B. C a wheel of sixty teeth on the same arbor as B, being the last wheel of the train, or effected, if preferred, by sixty steel pins on the face of B. E,F, a lever locking the wheels C and B by the pressure of spring S, except when discharged by the pin p on the face of A. D, centre of suspension of the pendulum. Now suppose the wheels C and B locked by E, F, in such a position that the pallet P works within the teeth of B, without touching either way, and suppose a seconds pendulum set in action under these circumstances; then will the force of oscillation given to it drive the small wheel round by means of the pallets X, Y, with a dead beat indicating seconds at every vibration, so as to make the seconds hand revolve once in 60''. At the 60th second the pin p will come into contact with the lever E, F, and unlock B, which has remained in a state of repose for 59'', during which time the pallet P has had no connection with the swing wheel B, and the pendulum has vibrated perfectly free and detached from the moving power. On being unlocked, however, as above described, the wheel B starts forward by the action of the first mover, and, encountering the pallet P, gives it an impulse regulated to restore the oscillating power lost by the pendulum during the 59 vibrations of seconds; at the end of the 60'' second, however, the pin p has escaped the lever E, F, and the wheels C and B are again locked so as to allow of 59 more free vibrations of the pendulum until the pin p comes round at the 60'' to release them again. Thus then there is obtained by the common pendulum a perfect and extreme detachment for 59'' of the minute, and it is evident that the principle may be extended by increasing the numbers to any greater degree within the limits of the inherent and detached oscillating force of which the pendulum can be made capable without increasing the time of the oscillation, and also without introducing any auxiliary force between the first mover and the regulator, contrary, as before stated, to the properties of every escapement yet applied. I shall now, therefore, compare the advantages of this mode with the present system of detached escapements.

In the first place the description of its action shews how much more the detachment is extended, and how much more the pendulum, as the regulating organ, is in the case left to the pure and unmixed action of gravity. In no escapement hitherto constructed has the pendulum a perfect freedom of oscillation, even for a single second, without having at some point or other to unlock some detent or perform some similar operation, which immediately brings upon it a controlling power in a direction contrary to its spontaneous effort, or an accelerating power to urge it forward, and which from the infinite nicety of application required must, from its constant interference, continually tend to effect the isochronism of the pendulum. Here, on the contrary, for 59'' the gravity of the pendulum is the sole and uncontrolled cause of its motion, having its arcs of vibration neither lengthened nor shortened by any urging or opposing cause, for the mere driving of the light and perfectly free second hand, constant, uniform, equally poised, and opposing no limit to the arcs of vibration, can be considered as nothing but a small increase in the frictino on the point of suspension until the 60'' second when it has to unlock the detent, and when at the same instant it receives a fresh supply of force, left, however, to operate as freely as before in the production of its effect upon 59 out of 60 of the subsequent oscillations of the pendulum.

In the second place, it will be found that considerably less first power is required to keep the same pendulum in action for a given time by this mode, because one great impulse will be found to be given with much less absolute friction than the sum of a great number of small forces, even if they amount to the same impulse; for as many parts (and even more) of the train are in motion, and in as much motion each to produce the lesser impulse as the greater one, and therefore in giving the one united impulse there is no more friction than in giving each of the sixty lesser ones; that is to say, the friction in applying the requisite maintaining power on this principle is only one sixtieth of what it is in the ordinary mode. But this is not all, for a pendulum thus allowed to act freely would maintain the force of vibration first given it for a much longer time and with much less variation in its arcs of oscillation than when coming constantly in contact with machinery, supposing no such power given; therefore, although that machinery may constantly impart to the pendulum fresh increments of force, still, in doing so it follows that by the very contact of machinery necessary for imparting this new force, a certain part of the inherent force at the time of contact is destroyed at every such contact, which were it no so acted upon would continue with little variation for considerable periods. To withold this contact as long as possible is therefore a direct saving of all this force for the time of such detachment; nor is there more of this inherent force destroyed in the contact necessary to give the one impulse every minute (or whatever the period may be) than would be lost in giving the divided impulses of each second; for the power required to unlock the detent, in one individual action at the end of the minute, is no more than in the other individual actions at the end of each second; nor is the friction in the one individual action of the pallet at the end of the minute more than in the other individual action of the end of each second. Here then is a saving of the inherent force of the pendulum in a ratio of 59 to 1, to be added to the saving of friction above stated to be also in that same ratio. Now these will be found to be the principal causes of that loss of motion in the vibrations of pendulums, which is to be restored by the first power, for the remaining causes of its loss of motion are but the friction on the point of suspension and the resistance of the air; on these two there certainly will be always an increase of efford required in the impulse of the maintaining power in the direct proportion of the length of time they are allowed to accumulate; but as these latter are extremely trifling compared to the other two causes of the loss of power above mentioned, in which there is an absolute gain of 59 to 1, it follows, that although the saving of power, on the whole, will not be exactly as 59 to 1, still it will be nearly so. To calculate it exactly is not, perhaps, possible, because it is difficult to say what the proportion of the friction of the point of suspension in the pendulum is to that of the whole work, and indeed it may not be the same in any two clocks, but is evidently, under any circumstances, an extremely small part of the whole.

In the third place, this application of the system of extreme detachment has all the advantages of increasing the time of repose, as to the wear of the work, in common with the inclined plane regulator; but it is of enhanced importance with reference to the escapement, for as in this case the swing wheel B, and the pallet P, by which the force is imparted to the pendulum, are only in contact once a minute, a relief is thus afforded to this most delicate and important part of the works, not accomplished by any escapement hitherto constructed. So also is the train in a like manner simplified, for the two swing wheel A and B are here the indicators of seconds and minutes, though both are connected immediately with the pendulum, that is, A revolves once in a minute, and B once in an hour, without any intemediate train. Hence arises a great additional saving of friction and work, for an eight-day clock requires only one pinion with the ordinary numbers, and an extremely small power; and a year clock may be made with only two pinions with the ordinary numbers of an eight-day clock, and with very little more power.

It is evident that this mode of escapement is in every respect above specified, and with similar advantages, as applicable to the vibration of the balance wheel of watches and chronometers as to the oscillations of the pendulum, with the exception only as to the duration of the period of detachment, inasmuch as the balance wheel cannot be given the same independent power of vibration from its spring which the pendulum possesses from its own gravity. The balance wheel may, however, in the same way, be as absolutely detached beyond the ordinary limits of its individual vibration, for five or ten of those vibrations, or perhaps for a considerably greater number, by increasing the weight of the balance in proportion to the strength of the spring, and, therefore, with proportionate savings of power, friction, and the other advantages belonging to this system of extreme detachment. With regard to the actual application, it is in fact so precisely the same as to machinery as well as effect, that it is needless to recapitulate it in the Specification with the mere substitution of the terms balance wheel for pendulum, &c., &c., and with the difference in the numbers depending on the different extent of the detachment; for any further Specification of it would obviously be but a recapitulation of this kind. It is certain, also, that in this movement, whether applied to clocks or watches, there may be verious configurations by which the same effect may be produced, still, however, as, to produce the same results, they can only be constructed after the mode of extreme detachment and with the distinct and characteristic properties of that detachment as above specified to be the basis of the Patent, they must be considered as integral parts of it. It cannot, therefore, be lawful for any one to attempt, by means of the double pallets and swing wheels here specified, or by any other system of machinery producing the same effect, to detach any pendulum or balance wheel from the first mover of the clock for any greater period than that limited by the individual vibrations of the pendulum or balance wheel, for such is the spirit of the detached escapement here specified and secured; that is to say, that a detachment is here effected with a common seconds pendulum, or with the common balance wheel, which would, on the ordinary construction of escapements, require enormous and impossible lengths of pendulums or diameters of balance wheels; so that it cannot but be contrary to the spirit of this Patent to apply any machinery which shall give this power of extreme detachment to any pendulum of [or?] balance wheel of less dimensions than would give such detachment according to the ordinary principles. It remains only to be added, that this system of detachment as relating to the construction of clocks is to be somewhat extended by the use of a compound instead of a simple pendulum; and although this cannot in practice be extended to any great degree, because to increase the times of vibration materially, and at the same time to maintain sufficient vigour of oscillation to produce any long continuance of vibration, this compound must as well as well as [sic] the simple pendulum, though not in an equal degree, be made of very inconvenient dimensions, still it may be applied so as to double some of the effects herein set forth. Such application of the compound pendulum, therefore, as being a mode here specified of extending the system of extreme detachment, which is the basis of this Patent, must be considered an integral part thereof; so that it cannot, therefore, be lawful for any one to make use of a compound pendulum consisting of two or more bobs, by the means of any machinery whatsoever for any combination or assimilation with the system of extreme detachment herein specified and declared.

In witness whereof, I, the said William Congreve, have hereunto set my hand and seal, the Twenty-third day of September, in the year of our Lord One thousand eight hundred and eight.

	Abstract = {Biological robots can be produced in large numbers, but are often controlled by uniform inputs. This makes position control of multiple robots inherently challenging.

This paper uses magnetically-steered ciliate eukaryon (Tetrahymena pyriformis) as a case study.  These cells swim at a constant speed, and can be turned by changing the orientation of an external magnetic field. We show that it is possible to steer multiple T. pyriformis to independent goals if their turning---modeled as a first-order system---has unique time constants.  We provide system identification tools to parameterize multiple cells in parallel.

We construct feedback control-Lyapunov methods that exploit differing phase-lags under a rotating magnetic field to steer multiple cells to independent target positions.
We prove that these techniques scale to any number of cells with unique first-order responses to the global magnetic field. We provide simulations steering hundreds of cells and validate our procedure in hardware experiments with multiple cells.

	Abstract = {Roboticists, biologists, and chemists are now producing large populations of simple robots, but controlling large populations of robots with limited capabilities is  difficult, due to communication and onboard-computation constraints. Direct human control of large populations seems even more challenging.
 
In this paper we investigate control of mobile robots that move in a 2D workspace using three different system models. We focus on a model that uses broadcast control inputs specified in the global reference frame.
 
In an obstacle-free workspace this system model is uncontrollable because it has only two controllable degrees of freedom---all robots receive the same inputs and move uniformly. We prove that adding a single obstacle can make the system controllable, for any number of robots. We provide a position control algorithm, and demonstrate through extensive testing with human subjects that many manipulation tasks can be reliably completed, even by novice users, under this system model, with performance benefits compared to the alternate models. 

We compare the sensing, computation, communication, time, and bandwidth costs for all three system models. Results are validated with extensive simulations and hardware experiments using over 100 robots.},

These bacterial microrobots can be remotely controlled using magnetic fields due to their internal chain of iron-oxide nanoparticles acting like a compass needle. This internal chain enables them to adopt a magnetotactic behavior that can be exploited to perform a variety of microscale tasks from microassembly and micro-manufacturing to the delivery through microvascular networks of therapeutic agents to tumors. To effectively support these applications, three-dimensional (3D) aggregations of MTB become essential in order to manipulate and guide the bacteria effectively in the human microvasculature to deliver a predefined dose of therapeutics. To achieve such aggregations in a 3D volume, time-varying magnetic field sequences were developed enabling us to simulate in time the existence of a magnetic monopole. This article presents and compares three different time-varying magnetic field sequences generated by three orthogonal pairs of electromagnets able to generate such 3D aggregations of MTB.},

	Abstract = {In this paper we investigate control of a large swarm of mobile particles (such as robots, sensors, or building material) that move in a 2D workspace using a global input signal such as gravity or a magnetic field. Upon activation of the field, each robot moves maximally in the same direction, until it hits a stationary obstacle or another stationary robot.
In an open workspace this system model is
of limited use because it has only two controllable degrees of freedom---all
robots receive the same inputs and move uniformly. We show that adding a
maze of obstacles to the environment can make the system drastically more complex but also more useful.

If we are given a fixed set of stationary obstacles, we prove that it is NP-hard to decide whether a given initial configuration can
be transformed into a desired target configuration. On the positive side, we provide constructive algorithms to design workspaces that efficiently implement arbitrary permutations between different configurations.},

	Abstract = {A novel robotic sensor is proposed to measure
both the contact angle and the force acting between the tip of a
surgical robot and soft tissue. The sensor is manufactured using
a planar lithography process that generates microchannels
that are subsequently filled with a conductive liquid. The
planar geometry is then molded onto a hemispherical plastic
scaffolding in a geometric configuration enabling estimation of
the contact angle (angle between robot tip tangent and tissue
surface normal) by the rotation of the sensor around its roll axis.
Contact force can also be estimated by monitoring the changes
in resistance in each microchannel. Bench top experimental
results indicate that, on average, the sensor can estimate the
angle of contact to within p/m2 Deg and the contact force to within p/m 5.3 g.},

bacterium (MTB), i.e., Magnetospirillum magnetotacticum,
within a micro-fabricated maze using a magneticbased
manipulation system. The effect of the channel wall on
the motion of the MTB is experimentally analyzed. This analysis
is done by comparing the characteristics of the transient- and
steady-states of the controlled MTB inside and outside a microfabricated
maze. In this analysis, the magnetic dipole moment of
our MTB is characterized using a motile technique (the u-turn
technique), then used in the realization of a closed-loop control
system. This control system allows the MTB to reach reference
positions within a micro-fabricated maze with a channel width
of 10 microm, at a velocity of 8 microm/s. Further, the control system
positions the MTB within a region-of-convergence of 10 micro m
in diameter. Due to the effect of the channel wall, we observe
that the velocity and the positioning accuracy of the MTB are
decreased and increased by 71% and 44%, respectively.},

carry out a wireless two-dimensional microassembly operation.
A magnetic-based manipulation system is used to control the
motion of the cluster under the influence of the applied magnetic
fields. Wireless motion control of the cluster is implemented at
an average velocity and maximum position tracking error of
144 microm/s and 50 microm, respectively. This control is used to achieve
point-to-point positioning of the cluster, manipulation of microobjects,
and assembly of microobjects into a microstructure.
The control system achieves stable positioning of the cluster,
while simultaneously compensating for the planar drag forces
on the cluster and the microobject. The presented magneticbased
microassembly technique allows for the selective pushing
and pulling of microobjects with specific geometries towards
their destinations inside a microstructure in an execution time
of 18 s, within a workspace of 1.8 mm x 2.4 mm.},

coverage paths for a mobile robot whose position and velocity
are subject to bounded error. Most prior approaches assume a
probabilistic model of uncertainty and maximize the expected
value of covered area. We assume a worst-case model of
uncertainty and---for a particular choice of coverage path---
are still able to guarantee complete coverage. We begin by
considering the special case in which the region to be covered
is a single point. The machinery we develop to express and
solve this problem immediately extends to guarantee coverage
of a small subset in the workspace. Finally, we use this subset
as a sort of virtual coverage implement, achieving complete
coverage of the entire workspace by tiling copies of the subset
along boustrophedon paths.},

The robot has a large sensor suite and many capabilities, but a kit cost of only around \$250 per robot.  This paper describes the release version of the robot hardware, the collective user interface that allows efficient operation, and two years of experience using the platform for research, teaching, and outreach.  Novel features of the robot design are molded plastic parts, an integrated bump sensor, high-precision quadrature encoders, and a flexible inter-robot communication and localization system.  The collective user interface supports an embedded human collective interface, gang charging and autonomous docking, ground truth localization, and centralized data collection.  The advanced design, low-cost, and small size can support university research with large populations of robots, exciting multi-robot curriculum in computer science, electrical engineering, and mechanical engineering.  We conclude with tales of joy and disaster from our experience using this platform in an introductory engineering class, graduate robotics class, and several outreach presentations.},

	Abstract = {Ensembles of magnetic particles are known to align and aggregate into multi-particle clusters in an applied magnetic field, and the physical laws governing these processes are well described in literature. However, it has been elusive how to achieve the opposite process, i.e. the disaggregation of particle clusters in a magnetic field. We report a novel method to disaggregate clusters of superparamagnetic microparticles using time-dependent magnetic fields. The disaggregating field is designed to generate repulsive dipole-dipole forces between the particles and to stabilize the disaggregated particles on a physical surface. We demonstrate the disaggregation of large clusters of several tens of particles, within about one minute, using fields generated by a multipole electromagnet. After the disaggregation process the particles are uniformly distributed over the surface and ready for further lab-on-chip processing. Our results represent a novel methodology to disaggregate magnetic particle clusters and thereby improve the effectiveness and reproducibility of biological assays based on magnetic microparticles.},

	Abstract = {A longstanding goal in biomedical research has been to create organotypic cocultures that faithfully represent native tissue environments. There is presently great interest in representative culture models of the lung, which is a particularly challenging tissue to recreate in vitro. This study used magnetic levitation in conjunction with magnetic nanoparticles as a means of creating an organized three-dimensional (3D) coculture of the bronchiole that sequentially layers cells in a manner similar to native tissue architecture. The 3D coculture model was assembled from four human cell types in the bronchiole: endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells (SMCs), fibroblasts, and epithelial cells (EpiCs). This study represents the first effort to combine these particular cell types into an organized bronchiole coculture. These cell layers were first cultured in 3D by magnetic levitation, and then manipulated into contact with a custom-made magnetic pen, and again cultured for 48 h. Hematoxylin and eosin staining of the resulting coculture showed four distinct layers within the 3D coculture. Immunohistochemistry confirmed the phenotype of each of the four cell types and showed organized extracellular matrix formation, particularly, with collagen type I. Positive stains for CD31, von Willebrand factor, smooth muscle α-actin, vimentin, and fibronectin demonstrate the maintenance of the phenotype for endothelial cells, SMCs, and fibroblasts. Positive stains for mucin-5AC, cytokeratin, and E-cadherin after 7 days with and without 1% fetal bovine serum showed that EpiCs maintained the phenotype and function. This study validates magnetic levitation as a method for the rapid creation of organized 3D cocultures that maintain the phenotype and induce extracellular matrix formation.},

	Abstract = {Microinjection and biopsy of oocytes and embryos in Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) require highly delicate handling of cells. In particular, efficient control of cell orientation is necessary to maintain their integrity during tool penetration, which currently remains challenging to accomplish by the existing method of repeated aspiration/release via micropipette. We present a microfluidic platform to automate the process of cell orientation control and trapping by means of hydrodyanmic force and vision-based position control. The device is accessible by conventional micropipettes via a cavity, allowing immobilized cells to be operated on. An orientation control algorithm based on the movement of the embryo within the microchannel is proposed. Visual tracking of the polar body is used to provide the information of cell orientation. Experimental results with mouse embryos indicate that cell orientation can be systematically controlled autonomously without human intervention and therefore provides a framework for further development of robotics approach to precise manipulation of microparticles within microfluidic devices.},

	Abstract = {Microrobots have been proposed for future biomedical applications in which they are able to navigate in viscous fluidic environments. Nature has inspired numerous microrobotic locomotion designs{,} which are suitable for propulsion generation at low Reynolds numbers. This article reviews the various swimming methods with particular focus on helical propulsion inspired by E. coli bacteria. There are various magnetic actuation methods for biomimetic and non-biomimetic microrobots{,} such as rotating fields{,} oscillating fields{,} or field gradients. They can be categorized into force-driven or torque-driven actuation methods. Both approaches are reviewed and a previous publication has shown that torque-driven actuation scales better to the micro- and nano-scale than force-driven actuation. Finally{,} the implementation of swarm or multi-agent control is discussed. The use of multiple microrobots may be beneficial for in vivo as well as in vitro applications. Thus{,} the frequency-dependent behavior of helical microrobots is discussed and preliminary experimental results are presented showing the decoupling of an individual agent within a group of three microrobots.},

	Abstract = {A major challenge for untethered microscale mobile robotics is the control of many agents in the same workspace for distributed operation. In this work, we present a new method to independently control multiple sub-mm microrobots in three dimensions (3D) using magnetic gradient pulling as the 3D motion generation method. Motion differentiation is accomplished through the use of geometrically or magnetically distinct microrobots which assume different magnetization directions in a rotating or oscillating magnetic field. This allows for different magnetic forces to be exerted on each, enabling independent motion control and path following of multiple microrobots along arbitrary 3D trajectories. Path following in 3D with less than 310 μm mean error is shown for a set of two microrobots of size 350 μm and 1500 μm, and independent motions are shown with three microrobots. It is also shown that control of more microrobots could be possible using improved magnetic coil hardware. Microrobot diversity is analyzed with regards to the effect on independent control. The proposed addressability method could be used for the 3D control of a team of microrobots inside microfluidic channels or in the human body for localized therapy or diagnostics.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents the Model Predictive Control (MPC) of magnetized Tetrahymena pyriformis (T. pyriformis) using a magnetic field. The magnetized T. pyriformis are generated by feeding spherical iron oxide particles into the cells. Using an external magnetic field, we change the movement direction of the cell, but the speed of the cell remains constant regardless of the strength of the external magnetic field. The contributions of this paper are threefold. First, the discrete-time plant model of the magnetized cell is generated using the least-squares method. Second, using the model of each cell, they are controlled to follow a reference track by an external magnetic field with MPC. Third, by using a predictor-like scheme to execute the plant input before the measurement of the cell position, we successfully solve the image-processing delay problem in the feedback system. In our results, we show three comparisons between different control schemes and an initial tracking to prove the effectiveness of the control approach.},

	Abstract = {The common view on feedforward control is that it
needs an accurate model in order to accurately predict a future
state of the system. However, in this paper we show that there
are model inaccuracies that do not affect the final position of a
motion, when using the right feedforward controller. Having an
accurate final position is the main requirement in the task we
consider: a pick-and-place task. We optimized the feedforward
controllers such that the effect of model inaccuracies on the final
position was minimized. The system we studied is a one DOF
robotic arm in the horizontal plane, of which we show simulation
and hardware results. The results show that the errors
in the final position can be reduced to approximately zero for
an inaccurate Coulomb, viscous or torque dependent friction.
Furthermore, errors in the final position can be reduced, but
not to zero, for an inaccurate inertia or motor constant. In
conclusion, we show that for certain model inaccuracies, no
feedback is required to eliminate the effect of an inaccurate
model on the final position of a motion.},

	Abstract = {We present control strategies that implement planar microassembly using groups of stress-engineered MEMS microrobots (MicroStressBots) controlled through a single global control signal. The global control signal couples the motion of the devices, causing the system to be highly underactuated. In order for the robots to assemble into arbitrary planar shapes despite the high degree of underactuation, it is desirable that each robot be independently maneuverable (independently controllable). To achieve independent control, we fabricated robots that behave (move) differently from one another in response to the same global control signal. We harnessed this differentiation to develop assembly control strategies, where the assembly goal is a desired geometric shape that can be obtained by connecting the chassis of individual robots. We derived and experimentally tested assembly plans that command some of the robots to make progress toward the goal, while other robots are constrained to remain in small circular trajectories (orbits) until it is their turn to move into the goal shape.Our control strategies were tested on systems of fabricated MicroStressBots. The robots are 240--280 µm × 60 µm × 7--20 µm in size and move simultaneously within a single operating environment. We demonstrated the feasibility of our control scheme by accurately assembling five different types of planar microstructures.},

	Abstract = {This paper addresses a navigation problem for a certain type of simple mobile robot modeled as a point moving in the plane. The only requirement on the robot is that it must be able to translate in a desired direction, with bounded angular error (measured in a global reference frame), until it reaches the nearest obstacle in its motion direction. One straightforward realization of this capability might use a noisy compass and a contact sensor. We present a planning algorithm that enables such a robot to navigate reliably through its environment. The algorithm constructs a directed graph in which each node is labeled with a subset of the environment boundary. Each edge of the graph is labeled with a sequence of actions that can move the robot from any location in one such set to some location in the other set. We use a variety of local planners to generate the edges, including a ``corner-finding'' technique that allows the robot to travel to and localize itself at a convex vertex of the environment boundary. The algorithm forms complete plans by searching the resulting graph. We have implemented this algorithm and present results from both simulation and a proof-of-concept physical realization.},

It also has a bounded stretch over a fully-connected graph, producing an efficient multi-hop communications network. Our algorithm uses artificial forces to move each robot to local potential energy wells. A local error correction algorithm detects and corrects most local lattice errors. Both algorithms are fully distributed, requiring local network geometry information, but no global coordinates. We present analysis of the potential energy wells that form the lattice, a proof of the upper bound on the spanning ratio of a hexagonal packing, and the error detecting and correcting algorithm.

	Abstract = {This paper presents a self-stabilizing distributed algorithm for the recovery  of large population of robots in complex environments---that is, to gather them all to a single location.We assume the robots do not have a map of the environment, but rather use short-range network communications and local sensing to physically route themselves towards the goal location. Since the robot's motion can disconnect this network in complex environments, we desire an algorithm that can provide a
guarantee of connectivity and efficient operation. Our approach constructs a spanning tree for physical routing, but only allows the leaves of this tree to navigate home. This distributed maximum-leaf spanning tree (DMLST) ensures connectivity,
while providing an efficient recovery by allowing the maximum number of robots to be mobile. The competitive ratio for the DMLST is very good, approaching the optimal
solution for out graphs. DMLST recovery has been tested in simulation, and implemented on a system of thirteen robots. While a simple clustering algorithm fails in all experiments, the DMLST recovery succeeds in most trials, and is reliable
and efficient.},

	Abstract = {We propose a novel method for object transport using granular convec-tion, in which the granular material is a robot swarm consisting of small robots with minimal sensors. Granular convection is commonly observed in the ``Brazil Nut Effect''. In this work, we consider the transported object to be passive, how-ever, and not actuated like the surrounding granular material. We show that the passive object can be transported to a given destination in spite of the fact that each robot does not know the location of the object being transported nor the loca-tion of the destination. Each robot moves based solely on a weak repulsive force from the destination and stochastic perturbations. We first show fundamental characteristics of a system with no communication between robots. We observe that very high or very low robot densities are detrimental to object transport. We then show that heterogeneous swarms increase performance. We propose two types of heterogeneous swarm systems: a swarm in which robots switch states probabilistically, and a swarm in which state propagates using local communica-tion. The signal propagation system shows the best performance in terms of suc-cess rate and accuracy in a wide range of densities.},

	Abstract = {In this dissertation, we apply the framework of ensemble control theory to derive an approximate steering algorithm for two classical robotic systems---the nonholonomic unicycle and the plate-ball manipulator---in the presence of model perturbation that scales all inputs by an unknown but bounded constant.

The basic idea is to maintain the set of all possible configurations and to select inputs that reduce the size of this set and drive it toward some goal configuration. The key insight is that the evolution of this set can be described by a family of control systems that depend continuously on the unknown constant. Ensemble control theory provides conditions under which it is possible to steer this entire family to a neighborhood of the goal configuration with a single open-loop input trajectory. For both the nonholonomic unicycle and the plate-ball manipulator, we show how to construct this trajectory using piecewise-constant inputs. We also validate our approach with hardware experiments, where the nonholonomic unicycle is a differential-drive robot with unknown wheel size, and the plate-ball manipulator is a planar motion stage that uses magnetic actuation to orient a sphere of unknown radius.

We conclude by showing how the same framework can be applied to feedback control of multi-robot systems under the constraint that every robot receives exactly the same control input. We focus on the nonholonomic unicycle, instantiated in experiment by a collection of differential-drive robots. Assuming that each robot has a unique wheel size, we derive a globally asymptotically stabilizing feedback control policy. We show that this policy is robust to standard models of noise and scales to an arbitrary number of robots. These results suggest that our approach may have possible future application to control of micro- and nano-scale robotic systems, which are often subject to similar constraints.

	Abstract = {We present a novel method for independently
controlling multiple stress-engineered MEMS microrobots (MicroStressBots)
through a single, global, control signal. Called
Turning-rate Selective Control (TSC), this new technique employs
designed variations in turning rates between individual microrobots
to differentiate their motion. Despite all robots moving
simultaneously and being identical except for exhibiting different
turning rates, TSC can individually and independently position
the robots' centers of rotation within a planar configuration
space. This allows the individual robots to be independently
maneuverable to within a distance equal to the turning radius
(approximately half of a microrobot width) away from an
arbitrary location (configuration excluding rotation) in R2. We
introduce the theory behind TSC and, by using fabricated microrobots,
show experimental results that confirm the feasibility of
TSC for controlling multiple MicroStressBots through a single,
global, control signal. We conclude by discussing how TSC
can extend the maximum number of independently controllable
MicroStressBots beyond previously published approaches.},

We apply our work to a differential-drive robot with unknown but bounded wheel radius, and validate our approach with hardware experiments.},

doi: 10.1109/ICRA.2012.6224638
Abstract: In current robotics research there is a vast body of work on algorithms and control methods for groups of decentralized cooperating robots, called a swarm or collective. These algorithms are generally meant to control collectives of hundreds or even thousands of robots; however, for reasons of cost, time, or complexity, they are generally validated in simulation only, or on a group of a few tens of robots. To address this issue, this paper presents Kilobot, a low-cost robot designed to make testing collective algorithms on hundreds or thousands of robots accessible to robotics researchers. To enable the possibility of large Kilobot collectives where the number of robots is an order of magnitude larger than the largest that exist today, each robot is made with only $14 worth of parts and takes 5 minutes to assemble. Furthermore, the robot design allows a single user to easily operate a large Kilobot collective, such as programming, powering on, and charging all robots, which would be difficult or impossible to do with many existing robotic systems.

	Abstract = {There are many examples of minimally invasive
surgery in which tethered robots are incapable of accurately reaching target locations deep inside the body either because
they are too large and result in tissue damage or because the
tortuosity of the path leads to loss of tip control. In these
situations, small untethered magnetically-powered robots may
hold the potential to act as delivery vehicles for therapeutic
agents. While MRI scanners provide a means to power, control
and image such robots as they move throughout the body, a
substantial challenge arises if the clinical application requires
more than one such robot. The resulting system is
underactuated and thus its controllability is in question. This
paper presents a simple motion planning algorithm for two
magnetic capsules and demonstrates through simulation and
experiment that nonlinear fluid damping can be exploited to
independently control the positions of the capsules.},

	Abstract = {This work addresses the characterization and control of Magnetotactic
Bacterium (MTB) which can be considered as a biological microrobot. Magnetic
dipole moment of the MTB and response to a field-with-alternating-direction are
characterized. First, the magnetic dipole moment is characterized using four tech-niques, i.e., Transmission Electron Microscope images, flip-time, rotating-field and u-turn techniques. This characterization results in an average magnetic dipole mo-ment of 3.32?10?16 A.m2 and 3.72?10?16 A.m2 for non-motile and motile MTB, respectively. Second, the frequency response analysis of MTB shows that its ve-locity decreases by 38% for a field-with-alternating-direction of 30 rad/s. Based on the characterized magnetic dipole moment, the magnetic force produced by our magnetic system is five orders-of-magnitude less than the propulsion force gener-ated by the flagellum of the MTB. Therefore, point-to-point positioning of MTB cannot be achieved by exerting a magnetic force. A closed-loop control strategy is devised based on calculating the position tracking error, and capitalizes on the fre-quency response analysis of the MTB. Point-to-point closed-loop control of MTB is achieved for a reference set-point of 60 mm with average velocity of 20 mm/s. The closed-loop control system positions the MTB within a region-of-convergence of 10 mm diameter.},

@article{Karaman2012,
	Abstract = {Abstract---Inspired by birds flying through cluttered environments
such as dense forests, this paper studies the theoretical
foundations of a novel motion planning problem: high-speed
navigation through a randomly-generated obstacle field when
only the statistics of the obstacle generating process are known
a priori. Resembling a planar forest environment, the obstacle
generating process is assumed to determine the locations and sizes
of disk-shaped obstacles. When this process is ergodic, and under
mild technical conditions on the dynamics of the bird, it is shown
that the existence of an infinite collision-free trajectory through
the forest exhibits a phase transition. On one hand, if the bird
flies faster than a certain critical speed, then, with probability
one, there is no infinite collision-free trajectory, i.e., the bird will
eventually collide with some tree, almost surely, regardless of the
planning algorithm governing the bird's motion. On the other
hand, if the bird flies slower than this critical speed, then there
exists at least one infinite collision-free trajectory, almost surely.
Lower and upper bounds on the critical speed are derived for
the special case of a homogeneous Poisson forest considering
a simple model for the bird's dynamics. For the same case,
an equivalent percolation model is provided. Using this model,
the phase diagram is approximated in Monte-Carlo simulations.
This paper also establishes novel connections between robot
motion planning and statistical physics through ergodic theory
and percolation theory, which may be of independent interest.

In both simulated and real robot experiments, we demonstrate that our method produces optimal solutions for simple problems and exhibits novel emergent behaviors for complex scenarios. Assignment Space takes advantage of the domain structure by splitting the planning up into three stages, effectively reducing the search space size and enabling the planner to produce optimized plans in seconds. Our algorithm finds solutions of comparable quality to complete configuration space search while reducing the computing time to seconds, which allows our approach to be applied in practical scenarios in real-time.},

@article{Bekris2012,
	Abstract = {When multiple robots operate in the same environment, it is desirable for scalability purposes to coordinate their motion in a distributed fashion while providing guarantees about their safety. If the robots have to respect second-order dynamics, this becomes a challenging problem, even for static environments. This work presents a replanning framework where each robot computes partial plans during each cycle, while executing a previously computed trajectory. Each robot communicates with its neighbors to select a trajectory that is safe over an infinite time horizon. The proposed approach does not require synchronization and allows the robots to dynamically change their cycles over time. This paper proves that the proposed motion coordination algorithm guarantees safety under this general setting. This framework is not specific to the underlying robot dynamics, as it can be used with a variety of dynamical systems, nor to the planning or control algorithm used to generate the robot trajectories. The performance of the approach is evaluated using a distributed multi-robot simulator on a computing cluster, where the simulated robots are forced to communicate by exchanging messages. The simulation results confirm the safety of the algorithm in various environments with up to 32 robots governed by second-order dynamics.

	Abstract = {We propose scale-free coordinates as an alternative coordinate system for multi-robot systems with large robot populations. Scale-free coordinates allow each robot to know, up to scaling, the relative position and orientation of other robots in the network.We consider a weak sensing model where each robot is only capable of measuring the angle, relative to its own heading, to each of its neighbors. Our contributions are three-fold. First, we derive a precise mathematical characterization of the computability of scale-free coordinates using only bearing measurements, and we describe an efficient algorithm to obtain them. Second, through simulations we show that even in graphs with low average vertex degree, most robots are able to compute the scale-free coordinates of their neighbors using only 2-hop bearing measurements. Finally, we present an algorithm to compute scale-free coordinates that is tailored to low-cost systems with limited communication bandwidth and sensor resolution. Our algorithm mitigates the impact of sensing errors through a simple yet effective noise sensitivity model. We validate our implementation with real-world robot experiments using static accuracy measurements and a simple scale-free motion controller.},

	Abstract = {A trajectory tracking controller based on differential flatness is presented for a nonlinear bicycle model. This controller maps the bicycle dynamics into a point mass located at a center of oscillation with an additional degree of freedom of yaw dynamics. A state transformation is performed that reveals structure in the yaw dynamics resembling a Li{\'e}nard system. A candidate Lyapunov function inspired by this structure is used to assess the stability of the yaw dynamics while tracking straight-line trajectories and steady turns. The basin of attraction of the controller is limited by actuator constraints and the presence of unstable equilibrium points during turns with high lateral acceleration. The controller properties and the stability of yaw dynamics are demonstrated in simulation.

	Abstract = {In this work, we develop methods for controlling multiple untethered magnetic micro-robots (Mag-mBots) without the need for a specialized substrate. We investigate Mag-mBots that are geometrically and magnetically designed to respond uniquely to the same input magnetic fields. Designs include: (1) geometrically similar Mag-mBots with different values of magnetization; (2) geometrically dissimilar Mag-mBots with similar magnetization; and (3) geometrically dissimilar Mag-mBots with dissimilar magnetization. The responses of both magnetically hard and soft Mag-mBots are investigated. By controlling the input magnetic fields, individual and sub-groups of Mag-mBots are able to locomote in a parallel fashion. Specifically, the magnitude and frequency of the imposed driving magnetic fields are used as selection methods among the Mag-mBots. Various methods for accomplishing motion discrimination are discussed, modeled, and tested. It is found that while fully decoupled control is not possible with this method, parallel actuation of sub-groups of Mag-mBots is possible and controllable.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a state estimator that reliably detects gait events during human walking with a portable powered ankle-foot orthosis (AFO), based only on measurements of the ankle angle and of contact forces at the toe and heel. Effective control of the AFO critically depends on detecting these gait events. A common approach detects gait events simply by checking if each measurement exceeds a given threshold. Our approach uses cross correlation between a window of past measurements and a learned model to estimate the configuration of the human walker, and detects gait events based on this estimate. We tested our approach in experiments with five healthy subjects and with one subject that had neuromuscular impairment. Using motion capture data for reference, we compared our approach to one based on thresholding and to another common one based on k-nearest neighbors. The results showed that our approach reduced the RMS error by up to 40% for the impaired subject and up to 49% for the healthy subjects. Moreover, our approach was robust to perturbations due to changes in walking speed and to control actuation.},

	Abstract = {The classical problem of robot coverage is to plan a path that brings a point on the robot within a fixed distance of every point in the free space. In the presence of significant uncertainty in sensing and actuation, it may no longer be possible to guarantee that the robot covers all of the free space all the time, and so it becomes unclear what problem we are trying to solve. We will restore clarity by adopting a ``probably approximately correct'' measure of performance that captures the probability 1-delta" of covering a fraction 1-epsilon of the free space. The problem of coverage for a robot with uncertainty is then to plan a feedback policy that achieves a given value of epsilon and delta. Just as solutions to the classical problem are judged by the resulting path length, solutions to our problem are judged by the required execution time. We will show the practical utility of our performance measure by applying it to several examples in simulation.},

	Abstract = {Abstract---This paper presents the design, fabrication, and
evaluation of a novel type of valve that uses an electropermanent
magnet [1]. This valve is then used to build actuators for a soft
robot. The developed EPM valves require only a brief (5 ms)
pulse of current to turn flow on or off for an indefinite period of
time. EPMvalves are characterized and demonstrated to be well
suited for the control of elastomer fluidic actuators. The valves
drive the pressurization and depressurization of fluidic channels
within soft actuators. Furthermore, the forward locomotion of
a soft, multi-actuator rolling robot is driven by EPM valves.
The small size and energy-efficiency of EPM valves may make
them valuable in soft mobile robot applications.},

	Abstract = {While the use of naturally-occurring features is a central focus of machine perception, artificial features (fiducials) play an important role in creating controllable experiments, ground truthing, and in simplifying the development of systems where perception is not the central objective. We describe a new visual fiducial system that uses a 2D bar code style "tag", allowing full 6 DOF localization of features from a single image. Our system improves upon previous systems, incorporating a fast and robust line detection system, a stronger digital coding system, and greater robustness to occlusion, warping, and lens distortion.

Abstract: We address the controller design and the trajectory generation for a quadrotor maneuvering in three dimensions in a tightly constrained setting typical of indoor environments. In such settings, it is necessary to allow for significant excursions of the attitude from the hover state and small angle approximations cannot be justified for the roll and pitch. We develop an algorithm that enables the real-time generation of optimal trajectories through a sequence of 3-D positions and yaw angles, while ensuring safe passage through specified corridors and satisfying constraints on velocities, accelerations and inputs. A nonlinear controller ensures the faithful tracking of these trajectories. Experimental results illustrate the application of the method to fast motion (5-10 body lengths/second) in three-dimensional slalom courses.

	Abstract = {Computing the ``average'' orientation of lines and rotations is non-trivial due to the need to account for the periodicity of rotation. For example, the average of +10 and +350 degrees is 0 (or 360) degrees, not 180. This problem arises in many disciplines, particularly those in which empirically collected data is processed or filtered. In this paper, we review a common but sub-optimal method for computing average orientation and provide a new geometric interpretation. We also propose a new method which provides additional insights into the geometry of the problem. Our new method also produces significantly more accurate results in the regime of operation usually encountered in robotics applications. We characterize this regime and provide guidance regarding which method to use, and when.

	Annote = {An important aspect of numerically approximating the solution of an infinite-horizon optimal control problem is the manner in which the horizon is treated. Generally, an infinite-horizon optimal control problem is approximated with a finite-horizon problem. In such cases, regardless of the finite duration of the approximation, the final time lies an infinite duration from the actual horizon at In this paper we describe two new direct pseudospectral methods using Legendre--Gauss (LG) and Legendre--Gauss--Radau (LGR) collocation for solving infinite-horizon optimal control problems numerically. A smooth, strictly monotonic transformation is used to map the infinite time domain onto a half-open interval The resulting problem on the finite interval is transcribed to a nonlinear programming problem using collocation. The proposed methods yield approximations to the state and the costate on the entire horizon, including approximations at . These pseudospectral methods can be written equivalently in either a differential or an implicit integral form. In numerical experiments, the discrete solution exhibits exponential convergence as a function of the number of collocation points. It is shown that the map can be tuned to improve the quality of the discrete approximation.},

turbulent flow. The movement of the sphere is recorded with two high-speed cameras. Its orientation
is tracked using a novel, efficient algorithm; it is based on the identification of possible orientation
``candidates'' at each time step, with the dynamics later obtained from maximization of a likelihood
function. Analysis of the resulting linear and angular velocities and accelerations reveal a surprising
intermittency for an object whose size lies in the inertial range, close to the integral scale of the
underlying turbulent flow.  2011 American Institute of Physics. [doi:10.1063/1.3554304]},

@article{Motabar2011,
	Abstract = {Recent theoretical and experimental results have demonstrated that it is possible to orient quasi-spherical objects such as apples by taking advantage of inertial effects during rotation. In practice, an apple rolled down a track consisting of two parallel rails tends to move to an orientation in which the stem/calyx axis is parallel to the plane of the track and perpendicular to the direction of travel as angular velocity increases. In this study, orientation tests were conducted using hothouse, globe, and plum tomatoes to demonstrate that quasi-spherical produce other than apples could be oriented using inertial effects. In addition, to allow testing of theoretical predictions regarding effects of shape on the orientation process, the three tomato cultivars were selected to correspond to the three shape classes used to for theoretical analyses: elongated, spherical, and squat. Single-pass and three-pass orientation rates for hothouse and plum tomatoes were about 90% and 100%, respectively. For the globe tomatoes, which tended to be "perfectly" spherical and which had uniform internal density distributions, three-pass orientation rates approached 90%. These results support the theoretical finding that it would be relatively easy to orient elongated and squat objects, and more difficult to orient spherical objects. In conclusion, rolling quasi-spherical produce down tracks consisting of two parallel rails is a commercially viable method for orienting such produce for imaging.},

Abstract: In this article, we investigate the problem of simultaneously steering an uncountable family of finite-dimensional time-varying linear systems with the same control signal. This class of control problems motivates further research in the new subject of control theory called Ensemble Control, a notion coming from the study of complex spin dynamics in nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and imaging. We derive the necessary and sufficient controllability conditions and an accompanying analytical optimal control law for an ensemble of finite-dimensional time-varying linear systems. We show that ensemble controllability is in connection with singular values of the operator characterizing the system dynamics. In addition, the problem of optimal ensemble control of harmonic oscillators is studied to demonstrate the controllability results. We show that the optimal solutions are pertinent to the study of time-frequency limited signals and prolate spheroidal wave functions. A systematic study of ensemble control systems has immediate applications to dynamical systems with parameter uncertainty as well as to wide-ranging areas such as neuroscience and quantum control. The work in ensemble control will foster further developments in mathematical control and systems theory.

	Annote = {A method is presented for direct trajectory optimization and costate estimation of finite-horizon and infinite-horizon optimal control problems using global collocation at Legendre-Gauss-Radau (LGR) points. A key feature of the method is that it provides an accurate way to map the KKT multipliers of the nonlinear programming problem to the costates of the optimal control problem. More precisely, it is shown that the dual multipliers for the discrete scheme correspond to a pseudospectral approximation of the adjoint equation using polynomials one degree smaller than that used for the state equation. The relationship between the coefficients of the pseudospectral scheme for the state equation and for the adjoint equation is established. Also, it is shown that the inverse of the pseudospectral LGR differentiation matrix is precisely the matrix associated with an implicit LGR integration scheme. Hence, the method presented in this paper can be thought of as either a global implicit integration method or a pseudospectral method. Numerical results show that the use of LGR collocation as described in this paper leads to the ability to determine accurate primal and dual solutions for both finite and infinite-horizon optimal control problems.

Stability estimates are obtained in either case in terms of the Lipschitz constant for the governing matrices and the assumed uniform decay rate of the corresponding frozen time linear systems. The main techniques used in the analysis are comparison methods, scaling and the application of continuous stability estimates to the discrete case. Counterexamples are presented to show the necessity of the stability hypotheses. The discrete results are applied to derive sufficient conditions for the stability of a backward Euler approximation of a time-varying system and a one-leg linear multistep approximation of a scalar system.},

	Abstract = { We consider the planning and control of multiple aerial robots manipulating and transporting a payload in three dimensions via cables. Individual robot control laws and motion plans enable the control of the payload (position and orientation) along a desired trajectory. We address the fact that robot configurations may admit multiple payload equilibrium solutions by developing constraints for the robot configuration that guarantee the existence of a unique payload pose. Further, we formulate individual robot control laws that enforce these constraints and enable the design of non-trivial payload motion plans. Finally, we propose two quality measures for motion plan design that minimize individual robot motion and maximize payload stability along the trajectory. The methods proposed in the work are evaluated through simulation and experimentation with a team of three quadrotors.},

We identify and discuss results showing technologies that mitigate the observed problems such as specialized interfaces, and adaptive systems. In the report, we first present an overview of definitions and important terms of supervisory control and human-agent teaming. We then discuss human performance issues in supervisory control of multiple robots with regard to operator multitasking performance, trust in automation, situation awareness, and operator workload. In the following sections, we review research findings for specific areas of supervisory control of multiple ground robots, aerial robots, and heterogeneous robots (using different types of robots in the same mission). In the last section, we review innovative techniques and technologies designed to enhance operator performance and reduce potential performance degradations identified in the literature.},

	Abstract = {This paper reports the successful navigation of Magnetotactic Bacteria (MTB) towards regions located inside a solid tumor using a computer controlled set of magnetic coils. MTB uses two flagella bundles connected to rotary molecular motors as a propulsion system enabling them to reach swimming velocities of 300mums-1 without external source of power. Acting like autonomous microrobots, they can be remotely controlled by an appropriate magnetic guidance system as their swimming direction is predominantly determined by the direction of the ambient magnetic field. In order to cope with the harsh environment of the solid tumor and to bypass the lack of knowledge of the internal vessels architecture forming the route to the tumor, fundamental MTB motion properties are taken into account in addition to their ability to swim along the magnetic field. The studies revealed the presence of these bacteria in the necrotic zone of a solid tumor. Preliminary results suggest that not only the magnetic guidance can help enhancing the uniform distribution of MTB inside the tumor for therapeutic or diagnostic purposes, but the experimental data showed that they could perform accurately and efficiently under computer control, many of the tasks previously envisioned for future synthetic microrobots of only 1 to 2 micrometers in diameter and designed to operate in the human microvascular network.},

	Annote = {A unified framework is presented for the numerical solution of optimal control problems using collocation at Legendre--Gauss (LG), Legendre--Gauss--Radau (LGR), and Legendre--Gauss--Lobatto (LGL) points. It is shown that the LG and LGR differentiation matrices are rectangular and full rank whereas the LGL differentiation matrix is square and singular. Consequently, the LG and LGR schemes can be expressed equivalently in either differential or integral form, while the LGL differential and integral forms are not equivalent. Transformations are developed that relate the Lagrange multipliers of the discrete nonlinear programming problem to the costates of the continuous optimal control problem. The LG and LGR discrete costate systems are full rank while the LGL discrete costate system is rank-deficient. The LGL costate approximation is found to have an error that oscillates about the true solution and this error is shown by example to be due to the null space in the LGL discrete costate system. An example is considered to assess the accuracy and features of each collocation scheme.

We apply our result to proof-of-concept hardware experiments with a planar robot arm searching for a metal object using an inductive proximity sensor. In particular, we show that our approach easily extends to optimal search along arbitrary curves, such as raster-scan patterns that might be useful in other applications like robot search-and-rescue.},

	Abstract = {In this paper we address the modeling, control, and planning of planar manipulation tasks with multiple robots equipped with simple end-effectors. Each robot is able to influence the motion of an object either by exerting forces through the end-effector or by contact through a robot body. We develop a quasi-static model for the planar manipulation task that incorporates mathematical models of the object-ground contact, the object-robot contact and the compliant end-effector. This model allows us to predict object velocities for specified robot motions. We use this model to develop a simple motion planning algorithm for object manipulation that allows robots to select grasps, regrasp when necessary and manipulate an object along desired trajec-tories. Our experiments validate the mathematical models and demonstrate the feasibility of multirobot manipulation using the quasi-static model and the motion planning algorithm. },

	Abstract = {This paper describes a passive stereo system for capturing the 3D geometry of a face in a single-shot under standard light sources. The system is low-cost and easy to deploy. Results are submillimeter accurate and commensurate with those from state-of-the-art systems based on active lighting, and the models meet the quality requirements of a demanding domain like the movie industry. Recovered models are shown for captures from both high-end cameras in a studio setting and from a consumer binocular-stereo camera, demonstrating scalability across a spectrum of camera deployments, and showing the potential for 3D face modeling to move beyond the professional arena and into the emerging consumer market in stereoscopic photography.

Our primary technical contribution is a modification of standard stereo refinement methods to capture pore-scale geometry, using a qualitative approach that produces visually realistic results. The second technical contribution is a calibration method suited to face capture systems. The systemic contribution includes multiple demonstrations of system robustness and quality. These include capture in a studio setup, capture off a consumer binocular-stereo camera, scanning of faces of varying gender and ethnicity and age, capture of highly-transient facial expression, and scanning a physical mask to provide ground-truth validation.},

	Abstract = {We study the controllability of the Bloch equation, for an ensemble of non
interacting half-spins, in a static magnetic field, with dispersion in the Larmor frequency.
This system may be seen as a prototype for infinite dimensional bilinear systems with
continuous spectrum, whose controllability is not well understood. We provide several
mathematical answers, with discrimination between approximate and exact controllability,
and between finite time or infinite time controllability: this system is not exactly
controllable in finite time T with bounded controls in L2(0, T ), but it is approximately
controllable in Linf in finite time with unbounded controls in L inf loc([0, +inf)). Moreover,
we propose explicit controls realizing the asymptotic exact controllability to a uniform
state of spin +1/2 or -1/2.

	Abstract = {The artificial bacterial flagellum (ABF), a helical swimming microrobot,
	has the potential to be used for biomedical applications such as
	cellular and intracellular manipulation. The velocity and the propulsive
	force of the ABF can be controlled by the input frequency of the
	rotating magnetic field. In this paper the swimming behavior of the
	ABF near a solid surface is reported. Three regions have been observed
	for the frequency-dependent swimming behavior of the ABF, i.e. the
	step-out, the linear and the drift-dominated region. At low frequencies
	it has been found that the desired screwtype motion is replaced by
	a wobbling swimming movement with a frequency-dependent precession
	angle. Moreover, the experimental results show that the wobbling
	motion of the ABF enhances the undesired sidewise drift due to wall
	effects. Additionally, the cause of the precession motion has been
	investigated by a hydrodynamic model. Our results imply that the
	linear range of the input magnetic frequency and the output ABF velocity
	is not only limited by the applicable torque at high frequencies
	but also by the wobbling of helical swimming at low frequencies.},

	Abstract = {An algorithm is described to solve multiple-phase optimal control problems using a recently developed numerical method called the Gauss pseudospectral method. The algorithm is well suited for use in modern vectorized programming languages such as FORTRAN 95 and MATLAB. The algorithm discretizes the cost functional and the differential-algebraic equations in each phase of the optimal control problem. The phases are then connected using linkage conditions on the state and time. A large-scale nonlinear programming problem (NLP) arises from the discretization and the significant features of the NLP are described in detail. A particular reusable MATLAB implementation of the algorithm, called GPOPS, is applied to three classical optimal control problems to demonstrate its utility. The algorithm described in this article will provide researchers and engineers a useful software tool and a reference when it is desired to implement the Gauss pseudospectral method in other programming languages.},

	Abstract = {Advances in medical imaging now provides detailed images of solid tumors inside the body and miniaturized energy delivery systems enable tumor destruction through local heating powered by a thin electrode. However, the use of thermal ablation as a first line of treatment is limited due to the difficulty in accurately matching a desired treatment and a limited region of active heating around an electrode. The purpose of this research is to identify and quantify the current limitations of image-guided interventional procedures and subsequently develop a procedure and devices to enable accurate and efficient execution of image-based interventional plans and thus ablation of a tumor of any shape with minimal damage to surrounding tissue. Current limitations of probe placement for ablation therapy were determined by a detailed retrospective study of 50 representative CT-guided procedures. On average, 21 CT scans were performed for a given procedure (range 11-38), with the majority devoted to needle orientation and insertion (mean number of scans was 54%) and trajectory planning (mean number of scans was 19%). A regression analysis yielded that smaller and deeper lesions were associated with a higher number of CT scans for needle orientation and insertion; highlighting the difficulty in targeting. Another challenge identified was repositioning the instrument distal tip within tissue. The first robot is a patient-mounted device that aligns an instrument along a desired trajectory via two motor-actuated concentric, crossed, and partially nested hoops. A carriage rides in the hoops and grips and inserts an instrument via a two degree-of-freedom friction drive. An imagebased point-and-click user interface relates appropriate clicks on the medical images to robot commands. Mounting directly on the patient provides a sufficiently stable and safe platform for actuation and eliminates the need to compensate for chest motion; thereby reducing the cost and complexity compared to other devices. Phantom experiments in a realistic clinical setting demonstrated a mean targeting accuracy of 3.5 mm with an average of five CT scans. The second robot is for repositioning the distal tip of a medical instrument to adjacent points within tissue. The steering mechanism is based on the concept of substantially straightening a pre-curved Nitinol stylet by retracting it into a concentric outer cannula, and re-deploying it at different axial and rotational cannula positions. The proximal end of the cannula is attached to the distal end of a screw-spline that enables it to be translated and rotated with respect to the casing. Translation of the stylet relative to the cannula is achieved with a second concentric, nested smaller diameter screw that is constrained to rotate with the cannula. The robot mechanism is compatible with the CT images, light enough to be supported on a patient's chest or attached to standard stereotactic frames. Targeting experiments in a gelatin phantom demonstrated a mean targeting error of 1.8 mm between the stylet tip and that predicted with a kinematic model. Ultimately, these types of systems are envisioned being used together as part of a highly dexterous patient-mounted positioning platform that can accurately perform ablation of large and irregularly shaped tumors inside medical imaging machines - offering the potential to replace expensive and traumatic surgeries with minimally invasive out-patient procedures.},

@phdthesis{Rubenstein2010,
	Abstract = {In a large group of robots, which in the scope of this thesis is called a collective, the capabilities of the collective are often greater than the sum of the capabilities of the individual robots that make up that collective. This additional capability can be the result of the overall collective shape, and/or the robots' changing their behavior based on their location within the collective, defined as differentiation. These properties of the collective, namely the shape and the overall differentiation of robots in the shape (the desired spatial-temporal role pattern), can add capabilities to a collective, and therefore they are important to control. In the event that the shape of the collective and/or the spatial-temporal role pattern is damaged, then the collective can lose some or all of the capabilities gained by those properties. If the collective could re-gain the lost properties through self-healing, then it is possible to recover the lost capabilities as well. This self-healing could be possible if the robots are capable of moving to a new location within the collective, as well as changing their differentiated behavior.; In this thesis, a distributed control method called DASH (distributed self-assembly and self-healing) is presented, which empowers a collective of robots to robustly and consistently form and maintain a pre-defined shape and spatial-temporal role pattern. Furthermore, a control method called S-DASH (scalable distributed self-assembly and self-healing) allows the shape and spatial-temporal role pattern to be formed at a scale proportional to the number of robots currently in the collective. If this collective shape or spatial-temporal role pattern is damaged through the un-controlled movement, removal, or addition of some members of the collective, the existing members will recover the desired shape and spatial-temporal role pattern proportional to the new number of robots in the collective. The control methods are analyzed in terms of the class of acceptable shapes, how well it scales to the number of robots in the collective, and convergence to the desired shape and spatial-temporal role pattern. The control methods are then demonstrated in a simulated collective of simple robots.},

	Abstract = {We consider the problem of a sphere rolling on a curved surface and solve it by mapping it to the precession of a spin 1/2 in a magnetic field of variable magnitude and direction. The mapping can be of pedagogical use in discussing both rolling and spin precession. As an interesting example we show that the Landau-Zener problem corresponds to the rolling of a sphere on a Cornu spiral, and derive the probability of a non-adiabatic transition using the rolling language. We also discuss the adiabatic limit and the vanishing of geometric phases for rolling on curved surfaces.},

	Abstract = {Artificial bacterial flagella (ABFs) consist of helical tails resembling
	natural flagella fabricated by the self-scrolling of helical nanobelts
	and soft-magnetic heads composed of Cr/Ni/Au stacked thin films.
	ABFs are controlled wirelessly using a low-strength rotating magnetic
	field. Self-propelled devices such as these are of interest for in
	vitro and in vivo biomedical applications. Swimming tests of ABFs
	show a linear relationship between the frequency of the applied field
	and the translational velocity when the frequency is lower than the
	step-out frequency of the ABF. Moreover, the influences of head size
	on swimming velocity and the lateral drift of an ABF near a solid
	boundary are investigated. An experimental method to estimate the
	propulsion matrix of a helical swimmer under a light microscope is
	developed. Finally, swarm-like behavior of multiple ABFs controlled
	as a single entity is demonstrated.},

	Abstract = {3D rotations arise in many computer vision, computer graphics, and robotics problems and evaluation of the distance between two 3D rotations is often an essential task. This paper presents a detailed analysis of six functions for measuring distance between 3D rotations that have been proposed in the literature. Based on the well-developed theory behind 3D rotations, we demonstrate that five of them are bi-invariant metrics on SO(3) but that only four of them are boundedly equivalent to each other. We conclude that it is both spatially and computationally more efficient to use quaternions for 3D rotations. Lastly, by treating the two rotations as a true and an estimated rotation matrix, we illustrate the geometry associated with iso-error measures.},

Abstract: This paper surveys contact micromanipulation strategies that are developed to tackle the microscale-related phenomena in microassembly. Strategies are divided according to how they take account of adhesion forces. Micromanipulation refers to handling of objects that have dimensions below hundreds of micrometers with handling accuracy down to submicrometers. The line between micro- and nanomanipulation is not definite but typically the object size in nanomanipulation is considered to reach from atomic and molecular scale to hundreds of nanometers. In contact micromanipulation, the tool physically touches the manipulated objects during handling. Scaling-effect-induced adhesion forces severely complicate micromanipulation when compared to conventional macromanipulation. At microscale, the most important adhesive forces are van der Waals force, electrostatic force, and capillary force. Adhesion forces are also the reason behind the fairly low level of automation in microassembly systems. Improved success rate of micromanipulation operations requires that the special features of microscale phenomena be taken into consideration.

	Abstract = {Microrobots have the potential to dramatically change many aspects
	of medicine by navigating through bodily fluids to perform targeted
	diagnosis and therapy. Researchers have proposed numerous microrobotic
	swimming methods, with the vast majority utilizing magnetic fields
	to wirelessly power and control the microrobot. In this paper, we
	compare three promising methods of microrobot swimming (using magnetic
	fields to rotate helical propellers that mimic bacterial flagella,
	using magnetic fields to oscillate a magnetic head with a rigidly
	attached elastic tail, and pulling directly with magnetic field gradients)
	considering practical hardware limitations in the generation of magnetic
	fields. We find that helical propellers and elastic tails have very
	comparable performance, and they generally become more desirable
	than gradient pulling as size decreases and as distance from the
	magnetic-field-generation source increases. We provide a discussion
	of why helical propellers are likely the best overall choice for
	in vivo applications. },

	Abstract = { Robotics continues to provide researchers with an increasing ability to interact with objects at the nanoscale. As microrobotic and nanorobotic technologies mature, more interest is given to computer-assisted or automated approaches to manipulation. Although actuators are currently available that enable displacement resolutions in the subnanometer range, improvements in feedback technologies have not kept pace. Thus, many actuators that are capable of performing nanometer displacements are limited in automated tasks by the lack of suitable feedback mechanisms. This paper proposes the use of a rigid-model-based method for end-effector tracking in a scanning electron microscope to aid in enabling more precise automated manipulations and measurements. These models allow the system to leverage domain-specific knowledge to improve performance in a challenging tracking environment.},

studying the self-repairing processes found in nature. Proposed
model is considered with the aid of energy given from the

using small modules actuated by vibration. We first describe
the proposed self-repairing mechanism and its application to
the control of a group of modules. We report the development
of the vibrator used in this study and formulate the equation of
translational and rotational motions of modules placed on this
plate. The proposed mechanism is verified by carrying out numerical
simulation and experiments. In addition, we introduce
two simple structures based on the proposed mechanism.},

	Abstract = {Abstract~~In this study we treat scribbling motion as a compositional system in which a limited set of elementary strokes are capable of concatenating amongst themselves in an endless number of combinations, thus producing an unlimited repertoire of complex constructs. We broke the continuous scribblings into small units and then calculated the Markovian transition matrix between the trajectory clusters. The Markov states are grouped in a way that minimizes the loss of mutual information between adjacent strokes. The grouping algorithm is based on a novel markov-state bi-clustering algorithm derived from the Information-Bottleneck principle. This approach hierarchically decomposes scribblings into increasingly finer elements. We illustrate the usefulness of this approach by applying it to human scribbling. },

	Abstract = {We show that small-amplitude periodic motion of a rigid plate causes point parts in frictional contact with the plate to move as if they are in a position-dependent velocity field. Further, we prove that every periodic plate motion maps to a unique velocity field. By allowing a plate to oscillate with six degrees of freedom, we can create a large family of programmable velocity fields. We examine in detail the class of plate motions described by sinusoidal linear and angular accelerations with a single frequency. We hypothesize that this simple class can generate all velocity fields that have constant and linear terms with respect to position, as well as some quadratic fields with respect to position. This set includes fields with isolated sinks and squeeze lines that can be used to perform tasks such as sensorless part orientation. Several of these fields have been verified on our programmable parts-feeding oscillatory device (PPOD). The PPOD is a parallel manipulator similar to a Stewart platform, but with flexures as joints. An iterative learning control algorithm is described that moves the platform with the six-degree-of-freedom periodic motion that creates the desired velocity field.},

	Abstract = {We examine the ability of a swarm robotic system to transport cooperatively objects of different shapes and sizes. We simulate a group of autonomous mobile robots that can physically connect to each other and to the transported object. Controllers --- artificial neural networks --- are synthesised by an evolutionary algorithm. They are trained to let the robots self-assemble, that is, organise into collective physical structures, and transport the object towards a target location. We quantify the performance and the behaviour of the group. We show that the group can cope fairly well with objects of different geometries as well as with sudden changes in the target location. Moreover, we show that larger groups, which are made of up to 16 robots, make possible the transport of heavier objects. Finally, we discuss the limitations of the system in terms of task complexity, scalability, and fault tolerance, and point out potential directions for future research.

	Abstract = {The motion of submerged magnetic microspheres rolling at a glass-water interface has been studied using magnetic rotation and optical tweezers combined with bright field microscopy particle tracking techniques. Individual microspheres of varying surface roughness were magnetically rotated both in and out of an optical trap to induce rolling along either plain glass cover slides or glass cover slides functionalized with polyethylene glycol. It has been observed that the manipulated microspheres exhibited nonlinear dynamic rolling-while-slipping motion characterized by two motional regimes: At low rotational frequencies, the speed of microspheres free rolling along the surface increased proportionately with magnetic rotation rate; however, a further increase in the rotation frequency beyond a certain threshold revealed a sharp transition to a motion in which the microspheres slipped with respect to the external magnetic field, resulting in decreased rolling speeds. The effects of surface-microsphere interactions on the position of this threshold frequency are posed and investigated. Similar experiments with microspheres rolling while slipping in an optical trap showed congruent results.},

	Abstract = {This paper addresses the stabilization of admissible reference trajectories generated
with constant inputs for driftless systems on Lie groups. The general expression of the linear
approximation of the tracking error system is derived from the system's constants of structure
and a necessary condition for the controllability of this approximation is specified in terms of
the growth of the filtration of the Lie Algebra generated by the system's vector fields. This
condition is illustrated with examples of mechanical systems whose control inputs correspond
to velocity variables. By contrast with nonholonomic mobile robots whose kinematic equations
can be transformed into the chained form, the linearized system associated with the rolling
sphere is never controllable. Consequences of this lack of controllability as for stabilization
problems are discussed from a general viewpoint and addressed more specifically for the rolling
sphere. Finally, a practical stabilizer for this system based on the transverse function approach
is proposed.},

	Abstract = {A dedicated software architecture for a novel interventional method allowing the navigation of ferromagnetic endovascular devices using a standard real-time clinical MRI system is shown. Through a specially developed software environment integrating a tracking method and a real-time controller algorithm, a clinical 1.5T Siemens Avanto MRI system is adapted to provide new functionality for potential automated interventional applications. The proposed software architecture was successfully validated through in vivo controlled navigation inside the carotid artery of a swine. Here we present how this MRI-upgraded software environment could also be used in more complex vasculature models through the real-time navigation of a 1.5 mm diameter chrome steel bead in two different MR-compatible phantoms with flowless and quiescent flow conditions. The developed platform and software modules needed for such navigation are also presented. Real-time tracking achieved through a dedicated positioning method based on an off-resonance excitation technique has also been successfully integrated in the software platform while maintaining adequate real-time performance. These preliminary feasibility experiments suggest that navigation of such devices can be achieved using a similar software architecture on other conventional clinical MRI systems at an operational closed-loop control frequency of 32 Hz.},

Our goal is to utilize microorganisms as micro-robots in various applications by exploiting galvanotaxis (locomotor response to electrical stimulus) to actuate them. This requires automated motion control of swimming cells in 3-D space; in contrast, our previous work has been limited to 1-D or 2-D motion control on the focal plane. The system is capable of 3-D tracking and control of swimming cells by utilizing a high-speed vision system. A combination of "lock-on" tracking within the focal plane and automated focusing using a Depth-From-Diffraction method executed at 1-kHz frame rate ensures both detailed measurement and a large working space. Experimental results for closed-loop 3-D motion control of Paramecium cells trapped within a small 3-D region demonstrate the possibility of using microorganisms as micromachines.},

Abstract: We present a decentralized approach to multi- robot manipulation where the team of robots surround and trap an object and transport it, by dragging or pushing, to the goal configuration in an environment with obstacles. The proposed feedback controllers are obtained by sequentially composing vector fields or behaviors and are decentralized in the sense that robots do not exchange each other's state information. Rather, cooperative manipulation is achieved by relying solely on each robot's local information and a global knowledge of the task. We present computer simulations and experimental results obtained using our multi-robot testbed.

	Annote = { The human ankle varies impedance and delivers net positive work during the stance period of walking. In contrast, commercially available ankle-foot prostheses are passive during stance, causing many clinical problems for transtibial amputees, including non-symmetric gait patterns, higher gait metabolism, and poorer shock absorption. In this investigation, we develop and evaluate a myoelectric-driven, finite state controller for a powered ankle-foot prosthesis that modulates both impedance and power output during stance. The system employs both sensory inputs measured local to the external prosthesis, and myoelectric inputs measured from residual limb muscles. Using local prosthetic sensing, we first develop two finite state controllers to produce biomimetic movement patterns for level-ground and stair-descent gaits. We then employ myoelectric signals as control commands to manage the transition between these finite state controllers. To transition from level-ground to stairs, the amputee flexes the gastrocnemius muscle, triggering the prosthetic ankle to plantar flex at terminal swing, and initiating the stair-descent state machine algorithm. To transition back to level-ground walking, the amputee flexes the tibialis anterior muscle, triggering the ankle to remain dorsiflexed at terminal swing, and initiating the level-ground state machine algorithm. As a preliminary evaluation of clinical efficacy, we test the device on a transtibial amputee with both the proposed controller and a conventional passive-elastic control. We find that the amputee can robustly transition between the finite state controllers through direct muscle activation, allowing rapid transitioning from level-ground to stair walking patterns. Additionally, we find that the proposed finite state controllers result in a more biomimetic ankle response, producing net propulsive work during level-ground walking and greater shock absorption during stair descent. The results of this study highlight the potential of prosthetic leg controllers that exploit neural signals to trigger terrain-appropriate, local prosthetic leg behaviors.},

	Abstract = { Robots must complete their tasks in spite of unreliable actuators and limited, noisy sensing. In this paper, we consider the information requirements of such tasks. What sensing and actuation abilities are needed to complete a given task? Are some robot systems provably ``more powerful'', in terms of the tasks that they can complete, than others? Can we find meaningful equivalence classes of robot systems? This line of research is inspired by the theory of computation, which has produced similar results for abstract computing machines. Our basic contribution is a dominance relation over robot systems that formalizes the idea that some robots are stronger than others. This comparison, which is based on how the robots progress through their information spaces, induces a partial order over the set of robot systems. We prove some basic properties of this partial order and show that it is directly related to the robots' ability to complete tasks. We give examples to demonstrate the theory, including a detailed analysis of a limited-sensing global localization problem.},

This paper studies the problem of controlling the agents indirectly by specifying the motion of the targets. In particular, it considers the problem of maintaining a minimum separation distance between each pair of agents, something that is impossible to do with only one target. This paper shows that only two targets are necessary to maintain separation between four agents. It also shows results in simulation to support the conjecture that only two targets are necessary to maintain separation between any number of agents, given suitable initial conditions.},

The active material is broken up into many small cells, each with a small stochastic automaton controlling the cell displacement. A central controller measures only the summed displacement of all of the cells, and from this produces a feedback signal broadcast to all of the cells. The control system can produce a smooth displacement and is scalable to very many cells. A prototype actuator has been constructed from shape memory alloy having 50 cells. This prototype demonstrates the ability to track a desired position, and it confirms that convergence time of the controller can be modeled using the constant policy value iteration algorithm.},

	Abstract = { Self-reconfiguring robots have the potential to explore highly variable terrain, operating as parallel groups or combining to surmount large obstacles. If the modules are at a smaller scale, they may also be able to physically render arbitrary shapes in an interactive way. In order to realize these capabilities, groups with large numbers of modules must be used, and algorithms to control such large groups must be extremely scalable in order to be executed on simple modules. In this work, we present an algorithm for locomotion of lattice-based self-reconfiguring robots that uses constant memory per module with execution times that are sublinear in the number of modules. The algorithm is inspired by reinforcement learning and uses dynamic programming to plan module paths in parallel. We have also developed a novel localized cooperation scheme that allows the modules to move both without disconnecting the system and with small amounts of communication. The combined algorithm is able to direct locomotion over arbitrary obstacles, and due to continuous replanning the goal can be moved at any time to `joystick' the robot over the environment. The formulation of the goal used in the planning also encourages dynamic stability. We have developed both centralized and decentralized implementations in simulation, as well as an implementation for the Superbot system, and present empirical results showing the sublinear nature of our technique.},

	Abstract = {Many applications for autonomous agents require the agent to have accurate position data. Signal-strength based localization attempts to determine an agent's location in {R^n} from a scalar sensor reading z. This is a nontrivial problem because the mapping from {R^n} to z is noninvertible.
	
Indoor Localization attempts to solve this problem in an indoor environment. This adds challenges. Among these are the effects of signal interference; signal dropout due to walls, doors, and humans; and the expense of data collection.
	
This project implements a localization system on an autonomous system, the Seg-Monster. The SegMonster is a human-sized robot that rides a commercial Segway personal transporter. Local data from wheel-mounted encoders are combined with signal-strength based localization that interprets wireless signal strength using Gaussian processes to calculate a global position estimate.},

	controlling a continuum of dynamical systems with different dynamics

	theory, the challenge is to simultaneously steer a continuum of systems
	between points of interest with the same control signal. This raises
	some new and unexplored questions about controllability and optimal
	control of such systems. We analyze ensemble controllability and
	optimal control of linear systems and study in detail the problem
	of controlling an uncountable family of harmonic oscillators. We
	show how the ideas of polynomial approximation are in connection
	with the ensemble controllability.We also find the optimal ensemble

@article{DING2007,
	Abstract = {Using contact measurements, experimental evidence was obtained for the
existence of the rolling resistance moment. The critical rolling distance prior to
detachment is reported. Previously it has been argued that the critical rolling
distance should be related to the lattice size and/or the molecular length of the
particle and surface materials. However, there has been no theoretical prediction
for the critical value and, currently, the reasons for its existence are not fully
understood. For polystyrene latex (PSL) particles, measurements presented in the
current study on silicon suggest much higher values for the critical rolling distance
than previous anticipated levels. The current approach can also be employed to
measure the work of adhesion between a spherical particle and a flat surface
without the prior knowledge of the particle diameter since the rolling moment
stiffness is directly proportional to the work of adhesion with no dependence on
the diameter of the particle. Experimental results are compared with the available
data and good agreement between the theoretical predictions and the
experimental values is found.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we propose the impact manipulation
of a string-like hyper-flexible robot where an impact force
is applied to a given target point. The proposed impact
manipulation law consists of three phases; the feedforward and
feedback swing phases, and the positioning phase, based on the
information on the estimated angular velocity at the connecting
point between the hyper-flexible body and the actuator. First,
in the feedforward swing phase, we apply sinusoidal horizontal
motion generated by a linear actuator to one end of the
manipulator. Next, we switch to the feedback swing phase
where the estimated angular velocity at the connecting point
between the hyper-flexible body and the actuator is utilized to
obtain stably large swing motion of the manipulator. Finally,
in the positioning phase, we bring the actuator to the target
position after waiting for the timing judged from the angular
velocity information so as not to damp the obtained large swing
until the impact. Experimental results are shown to verify the
effectiveness of the proposed impact manipulation law.},

abstract={We address the problem of position trajectory-tracking and path-following control design for underactuated autonomous vehicles in the presence of possibly large modeling parametric uncertainty. For a general class of vehicles moving in either 2- or 3-D space, we demonstrate how adaptive switching supervisory control can be combined with a nonlinear Lyapunov-based tracking control law to solve the problem of global boundedness and convergence of the position tracking error to a neighborhood of the origin that can be made arbitrarily small. The desired trajectory does not need to be of a particular type (e.g., trimming trajectories) and can be any sufficiently smooth bounded curve parameterized by time. We also show how these results can be applied to solve the path-following problem, in which the vehicle is required to converge to and follow a path, without a specific temporal specification. We illustrate our design procedures through two vehicle control applications: a hovercraft (moving on a planar surface) and an underwater vehicle (moving in 3-D space). Simulations results are presented and discussed.},

	Annote = {In this paper a calibration technique aimed at identifying the odometric parameters of differential-drive mobile robots is proposed. The algorithm is based on two successive least-squares estimations based on the continuous-time kinematic equations of motion; the time-discretization error, thus, is avoided. The use of the least-squares technique is made possible by working on a linear mapping between the unknowns and the measurements and is not the result of a linearization. Another advantage of the proposed technique is that no specific path is required. The basic technique makes use of video-camera measurements and absolute position readings of the wheels'encoders; the use of different sensors and measurements of the wheels velocities is also discussed. Experimental results with a mobile robot Khepera II confirm the effectiveness of the proposed technique.},

	Abstract = {This paper describes a novel approach for multirobot
caging and manipulation, which relies on the team of
robots forming patterns that trap the object to be manipulated
and dragging or pushing the object to the goal configuration.
The controllers are obtained by sequential composition of vector
fields or behaviors and enable decentralized computation based
only on local information. Further, the control software for
each robot is identical and relies on very simple behaviors.
We present our experimental multi-robot system and simulation
and experimental results that demonstrate the robustness of this
approach.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents CRIC (Cross-Point Regions for Lossless Image Compression), a scheme for losslessly encoding and decoding images, especially medical images, by optimizing on the probability of cross points that neighbor points of grey levels 2n. The base of this statement is the effect of Gray coding on cross points. At first, the effect of Gray codes is determined on an adjacent data set because images characteristically contain data that does not change much in a specific area; then this effect is generalized for real data without losing generality for their statistical properties. This is especially true for medical images that have many regions with the same grey levels. The Gray code transformation makes the bit states of cross points change from the original data bits, so first the probabilities of data bits on specific bit planes in cross point regions and then the entropies of the messages are changed. These probabilities are estimated and compared with the probabilities of the original data bits. This change of probability has important effects on the encoding and decoding processes in lossless medical image compression.},

	Annote = {This paper presents both the theory and the experimental results of a method allowing simultaneous robot localization and odometry error estimation (both systematic and non-systematic) during the navigation. The estimation of the systematic components is carried out through an augmented Kalman filter, which estimates a state containing the robot configuration and the parameters characterizing the systematic component of the odometry error. It uses encoder readings as inputs and the readings from a laser range finder as observations. In this first filter, the non-systematic error is defined as constant and it is overestimated. Then, the estimation of the real non-systematic component is carried out through another Kalman filter, where the observations are obtained by two subsequent robot configurations provided by the previous augmented Kalman filter. There, the systematic parameters in the model are regularly updated with the values estimated by the first filter. The approach is theoretically developed for both the synchronous and the differential drive. A first validation is performed through very accurate simulations where both the drive systems are considered. Then, a series of experiments are carried out in an indoor environment by using a mobile platform with a differential drive.},

problem of on-line odometry self-calibration for a mobile robot.
A first series of results regards the problem of understanding
if a given system (consisting of a robot with several sensors)
contains the necessary information to perform the on-line
self calibration of the odometry. We consider several cases
corresponding to different odometry systems and different types
of robot sensors. Finally, we also consider the problem of
maximizing the calibration accuracy and we formulate this
problem as an optimal control problem. For the special case of a
holonomic vehicle, we derive second order differential equations
characterizing the solution, i.e. defining the best trajectory
which maximizes the calibration accuracy},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a review of recent rolling robots including Rollo from Helsinki University of Technology. Spherical Mobile Robot from the Politecnico of Bari, Sphericle from the University of Pisa, Spherobot from Michigan State University. August from Azad University of Qazvin and the University of Tehran, Deformable Robot from Ritsumeijan University. Kickbot from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Gravitational Wheeled Robot from Kinki University, Gyrover from Carnegie Mellon University, Roball from the Universit{\'e}de Sherbrooke, and Rotundus from the {\AA}ngstr{\"o}m Space Technology Center.  Seven rolling robot design principles are presented and discussed (Sprang central member. Car driven. Mobile masses. Hemispherical wheels, Gyroscopic stabilisation. Ballast mass - fixed axis, and Ballast mass - moving axis). Robots based on each of the design principles are shown and the performances of the robots are tabulated. An attempt is made to grade the design principles based on their suitability for movement over an unknown and varied but relatively smooth terrain. The result of this comparison suggests that a rolling robot based on a mobile masses principle would be best suited to this specific application.  Some wonderful rolling organisms are introduced and defined as ``active'' or ``passive'' depending on whether they generate their own rolling motion or external forces cause their rolling.},

Minimalist models have been studied for a broad array of tasks in robotics. In this paper, we consider the taskcompleting power of robots in terms of the sensors and actuators with which the robot is equipped. Our goal is to understand the relative power of different sets of sensors and actuators and to determine which of these sets enable the robot to complete its task. We define robots as collections of robotic primitives and provide a formal method for comparing the sensing and actuation power of robots constructed from these primitives. This comparison, which is based on the how the robots progress through their information spaces, induces a partial order over the set of robot systems. We prove some basic properties of this partial order and then apply it to a limited-sensing version of the global localization problem.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we show how to combine microfluidics and feedback control to independently steer multiple particles with micrometer accuracy in two spatial dimensions. The particles are steered by creating a fluid flow that carries all the particles from where they are to where they should be at each time step. Our control loop comprises sensing, computation, and actuation to steer particles along user-input trajectories. Particle locations are identified in real-time by an optical system and transferred to a control algorithm that then determines the electrode voltages necessary to create a flow field to carry all the particles to their next desired locations. The process repeats at the next time instant. Our method achieves inexpensive steering of particles by using conventional electroosmotic actuation in microfluidic channels. This type of particle steering does not require optical traps and can noninvasively steer neutral or charged particles and objects that cannot be captured by laser tweezers. (Laser tweezers cannot steer reflective particles, or particles where the index of refraction is lower than (or for more sophisticated optical vortex holographic tweezers does not differ substantially from) that of the surrounding medium.) We show proof-of-concept PDMS devices, having four and eight electrodes, with control algorithms that can steer one and three particles, respectively. In particular, we demonstrate experimentally that it is possible to use electroosmotic flow to accurately steer and trap multiple particles at once},

Our goal is to control a cluster of microorganisms as microscale smart robots for various applications, since microorganisms have efficient actuators and accurate sensors. Compared with single-cell level actuation methods proposed before, this method has the following advantages: (1) a cluster of microorganisms can cancel stochastic perturbations of behavior by taking the average; (2) a cluster of microorganisms can be more powerful than a single microorganism, and thus it can perform a variety of tasks. A visual feedback system is constructed to control cells using galvanotaxis (response to the electric field). Experimental results show the feasibility of visual feedback control of a paramecium cell cluster. In addition, micro-manipulation of small objects by the cell cluster is also demonstrated

	Abstract = {In this note we consider the following problem. Suppose a set of sensors is jointly trying to estimate a process. One sensor takes a measurement at every time step and the measurements are then exchanged among all the sensors. What is the sensor schedule that results in the minimum error covariance? We describe a stochastic sensor selection strategy that is easy to implement and is computationally tractable. The problem described above comes up in many domains out of which we discuss two. In the sensor selection problem, there are multiple sensors that cannot operate simultaneously (e.g., sonars in the same frequency band). Thus measurements need to be scheduled. In the sensor coverage problem, a geographical area needs to be covered by mobile sensors each with limited range. Thus from every position, the sensors obtain a different view-point of the area and the sensors need to optimize their trajectories. The algorithm is applied to these problems and illustrated through simple examples.

@article{Griffith2006,
	Abstract = {This paper describes a computational approach to designing a digital
       microfluidic system (DMFS) that can be rapidly reconfigured for
       new biochemical analyses. Such a ``lab-on-a-chip'' system for
       biochemical analysis, based on electrowetting or
       dielectrophoresis, must coordinate the motions of discrete
       droplets or biological cells using a planar array of
       electrodes. The authors have earlier introduced a layout-based
       system and demonstrated its flexibility through simulation,
       including the system's ability to perform multiple assays
       simultaneously. Since array-layout design and droplet-routing
       strategies are closely related in such a DMFS, their goal is to
       provide designers with algorithms that enable rapid simulation
       and control of these DMFS devices. In this paper, the effects
       of variations in the basic array-layout design, droplet-routing
       control algorithms, and droplet spacing on system performance
       are characterized. DMFS arrays with hardware limited row-column
       addressing are considered, and a polynomial-time algorithm for
       coordinating droplet movement under such hardware limitations

	Abstract = {We demonstrate how to use feedback control of microflows to steer multiple particles independently in planar microfluidic systems driven by electro-osmotic actuation. This technique enables the handling of biological materials, such as cells, bacteria, DNA, and drug packets, in a hand-held format using simple and easy-to-fabricate actuators. The feedback loop consists of a vision system which identifies the positions of the particles in real-time, a control algorithm that computes the actuator (electrode) inputs based on information received from the vision system, and a set of electrodes (actuators) that create the required flow through electro-osmotic forces to steer all the particles along their desired trajectories and correct for particle position errors and thermal noise. Here, we focus on the development of control algorithms to achieve the steering of particles: vision system implementation, fabrication of devices, and experimental validation is addressed in other publications. In particular, steering of a single (yeast cell) particle has been demonstrated experimentally in our prior research and we have recently demonstrated experimental steering of three particles independently. In this paper, we develop the control algorithms for steering multiple particles independently and we validate our control techniques using simulations with realistic sources of initial position errors and thermal noise. In this study, we assume perfect measurement and actuation.},

	Abstract = {We present a new framework for the crucial challenge of self-organization of a large sensor network. The basic scenario can be described as follows: Given a large swarm of immobile sensor nodes that have been scattered in a polygonal region, such as a street network. Nodes have no knowledge of size or shape of the environment or the position of other nodes. Moreover, they have no way of measuring coordinates, geometric distances to other nodes, or their direction. Their only way of interacting with other nodes is to send or to receive messages from any node that is within communication range. The objective is to develop algorithms and protocols that allow self-organization of the swarm into large-scale structures that reflect the structure of the street network, setting the stage for global routing, tracking and guiding algorithms.Our algorithms work in two stages: boundary recognition and topology extraction. All steps are strictly deterministic, yield fast distributed algorithms, and make no assumption on the distribution of nodes in the environment, other than sufficient density.},

	Abstract = {The number and type of unmanned vehicles sought in military operations continues to grow. A critical consideration in designing these systems is identifying interface types or interaction schemes that enhance an operator's ability to supervise multiple unmanned vehicles. Past research has explored how interface types impact overall performance measures (e.g. mission execution time), but has not extensively examined other human performance factors that might influence human-robot interaction. Within a dynamic military environment, it is particularly important to assess how interfaces impact an operator's ability to quickly adapt and alter the unmanned vehicle's tasking. To assess an operator's ability to confront this changing environment, we explored the impact of interface type on task switching. Research has shown performance costs (i.e. increased time response) when individuals switch between different tasks. Results from this study suggest that this task switching effect is also seen when participants controlling multiple unmanned vehicles switch between different strategies. Results also indicate that when utilizing a flexible delegation interface, participants did not incur as large a switch cost effect as they did when using an interface that allowed only the use of fixed automated control of the unmanned vehicles.},

Human-robot interfaces for interacting with hundreds of
autonomous robots must be very different from single-robot
interfaces. The central design challenge is developing
techniques to maintain, program, and interact with the
robots without having to handle them individually. This
requires robots that can support hands-free operation, which
drives many other aspects of the design.
This paper presents the design philosophy and practical
experience with human-robot interfaces to develop, debug,
and evaluate distributed algorithms on the 112-robot iRobot
Swarm. These human-robot interaction (HRI) techniques
fall into three categories: a physical infrastructure to
support hands-free operation, utility software for
centralized development and debugging, and carefully
designed lights, sounds and movement that allow the user
to interpret the inner workings of groups of robots without
having to look away or use special equipment. The end
result is a useable Swarm, with develop-run-debug cycle
times approaching that of a simulation.},

	Abstract = {Described is the potential use of a stability property of fruit to allow fruit to be oriented along the stem/calyx axis. Inspection using machine vision offers the potential for improved safety and quality of foods. However, effectiveness of fruit inspection has been limited by the difficulty of differentiating stem and calyx regions from problem sites. It is possible to orient fruit prior to imaging; however, commercial systems have had only limited impact due to mechanical complexity, cost, error, or some combination thereof. Preliminary tests using inertial properties demonstrated that apples could be oriented along the stem/calyx axis. Apples were rolled down a ramp consisting of two parallel tracks. When sufficient angular velocity was achieved, the apples moved to a configuration where the stem/calyx axis was perpendicular to the direction of travel. For this study, the theoretically stability of an ellipsoid-object subject to rotation was examined using the small perturbation method and the analysis using the action integral. For the small perturbation method, perturbations were assumed to be sufficiently small so that the associated nonlinear Euler equations could be linearized. Theoretical derivations, and a practical demonstration using Maple software, indicated that an object rotating at constant velocity was stable only when the object rotated around the axis of radial symmetry, e.g. the stem/calyx axis. Action is defined as the integral of kinetic energy minus potential energy over some time period. Ellipsoids were constructed by rotating an ellipse (x2/a2 + y2/b2 = 1) around the x-axis. Lower action values were assumed to indicate greater stability. Relative action values were generally lower (for a > b) for rotation around the x-axis (the axis of radial symmetry) compared to rotation around the y-axis, and the difference increased as a/b increased. These results justify efforts to develop a simple system for orienting fruit based-on rotational stability.

Abstract: The problem of the asymptotic stabilization of a five dimensional nonholonomic systems, namely the "ball and plate" or "rolling sphere" system, is discussed and solved by means of a hybrid control law relying on a suitable finite state machine. A control law is associated to each state of the machine and, by using a simple switching strategy, the origin is proven to be globally asymptotically stable in the sense of Lyapunov. Moreover, a particular function is proven to be a Lyapunov function for the considered hybrid system. The chosen control law takes naturally into account the presence of possible control saturations. Simulations are presented showing the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.

	Abstract = {Locally weighted projection regression (LWPR) is a new algorithm for incremental nonlinear function approximation in high-dimensional spaces with redundant and irrelevant input dimensions. At its core, it employs nonparametric regression with locally linear models. In order to stay computationally efficient and numerically robust, each local model performs the regression analysis with a small number of univariate regressions in selected directions in input space in the spirit of partial least squares regression. We discuss when and how local learning techniques can successfully work in high-dimensional spaces and review the various techniques for local dimensionality reduction before finally deriving the LWPR algorithm. The properties of LWPR are that it (1) learns rapidly with second-order learning methods based on incremental training, (2) uses statistically sound stochastic leave-one-out cross validation for learning without the need to memorize training data, (3) adjusts its weighting kernels based on only local information in order to minimize the danger of negative interference of incremental learning, (4) has a computational complexity that is linear in the number of inputs, and (5) can deal with a large number of-possibly redundant-inputs, as shown in various empirical evaluations with up to 90 dimensional data sets. For a probabilistic interpretation, predictive variance and confidence intervals are derived. To our knowledge, LWPR is the first truly incremental spatially localized learning method that can successfully and efficiently operate in very high-dimensional spaces.

       a set that is invariant under the mapping that corresponds to

Our approach makes use of two tools: an iterative control scheme and a nilpotent approximation of the system dynamics. The latter is used to compute an approximate steering control which, repeatedly applied to the system, guarantees asymptotic stability with exponential convergence to any desired set point, under appropriate conditions. For illustration, we apply the proposed strategy to design a stabilizing controller for the plate-ball manipulation system, a canonical example of nonflat nonholonomic mechanism. The theoretical performance and robustness of the controller are confirmed by simulations, both in the nominal case and in the presence of a perturbation on the ball radius.},

@article{Griffith2005,
	Abstract = {In this paper we present an approach to coordinate the motions of droplets in digital microfluidic systems, a new class of lab-on-a-chip systems for   biochemical analysis. A digital microfluidic system typically consists of a planar array of cells with electrodes that control the droplets. The primary  challenge in using droplet-based systems is that they require the simultaneous coordination of a potentially large number of droplets on the array as the  droplets move, mix, and split. In this paper we describe a general-purpose system that uses simple algorithms and yet is versatile. First, we present a semi-automated approach to generate the array layout in terms of components. Next, we discuss simple algorithms to select destination components for the droplets and a decentralized scheme for components to route the droplets on the   array. These are then combined into a reconfigurable system that has been simulated in software to perform analyses such as the DNA polymerase chain   reaction. The algorithms have been able to successfully coordinate hundreds of droplets simultaneously and perform one or more chemical analyses in parallel.   Because it is challenging to analytically characterize the behavior of such systems, simulation methods to detect potential system instability are proposed. },

Our control design is based on inputs in a rotating coordinate frame that individually produce primitive motions of the sphere along straight lines and circular arcs. The rotating coordinate frame is chosen in concert with Euler angle description of orientation and placement of the desired configuration at the singularity of the representation. In our paper, we separately establish global stability of the desired configuration and exponential convergence. Our theoretical claims are validated through numerical simulations.},

	Abstract = {In this paper we address the problem of transporting objects with multiple                     mobile robots using the concept of ``object closure''. In                     contrast to other manipulation techniques that are typically derived from form                     or force closure constraints, object closure requires the less stringent                     condition that the object be trapped or caged by the robots. Our basic goal in                     this paper is to develop decentralized control policies for a group of robots to                     move toward a goal position while maintaining a condition of object closure. We                     present experimental results that show polygonal mobile robots controlled using                     visual feedback, transporting a convex polygonal object in an obstacle free                     environment toward a prescribed goal.},

	Abstract = {This paper deals with the ball-plate manipulation problem considered as a typical but complicated model of a driftless nonholonomic system. Due to a strong nonlinearity of the ball-plate system, a state equation of the kinematic model cannot be transformed into a chained form, which is known to be effective in constructing a feedback control law for some driftless nonholonomic systems. To address this problem, we utilize a time-state control form, a kind of canonical form which covers a broader class of systems than the chained form. This form is first applied to two separate subproblems, position control, in which the planar position of the ball is controlled but not the orientation, and orientation control, in which the orientation is controlled without changing the positional relation between the ball and the plates. It turns out that there exists a linearly uncontrollable subspace in the transformed subsystem, which turns into controllable by a change of coordinates. This implies that the system has the structure of a system with two generators. We propose a control strategy using iterative changes of coordinates, ensuring convergence in the neighborhood of the origin. Finally, we unify the subproblems into simultaneous control of position and orientation, i.e., the whole configuration of the system. The important idea in the simultaneous control is the coordinate transformation, which enables us to avoid a singular point. Results of simulations show that the proposed method achieve robustness to a measurement noise and perturbation of radius of the ball.},

	Annote = {Robotics researchers have studied robots that can follow trails laid by other robots. We, on the other hand, study robots that leave trails in the terrain to cover closed terrain repeatedly. How to design such ant robots has so far been studied only theoretically for gross robot simplifications. In this article, we describe for the first time how to build physical ant robots that cover terrain and test their design both in realistic simulation environments and on a Pebbles III robot. We show that the coverage behavior of our ant robots can be modeled with a modified version of node counting, a real-time search method. We then report on first experiments that we performed to understand their efficiency and robustness in situations where some ant robots fail, they are moved without realizing this, the trails are of uneven quality, and some trails are destroyed. Finally, we report the results of a large-scale simulation experiment where ten ant robots covered a factory floor of 25 by 25 meters repeatedly over 85 hours without getting stuck.},

of the one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator is controllable.
We prove here that, contrary to such finite-dimensional approximations,
the original infinite-dimensional system is not controllable:Its controllable
part is of dimension 2 and corresponds to the dynamics of the average position.
More generally, we prove that, for the quantum harmonic oscillator of
any dimension, similar lacks of controllability occur whatever the number
of control is:the controllable part still corresponds to the average position
dynamics. We show, with the quantum particle in a moving quadratic potential,
that some physically interesting motion planning questions can be
however solved.},

	Abstract = {Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of generating uniform deterministic samples over the spheres and the three-dimensional rotation group, SO(3). The target applications include motion planning, optimization, and verification problems in robotics and in related areas, such as graphics, control theory and computational biology. We introduce an infinite sequence of samples that is shown to achieve: 1) low-dispersion, which aids in the development of resolution complete algorithms, 2) lattice structure, which allows easy neighbor identification that is comparable to what is obtained for a grid in Rd, and 3) incremental quality, which is similar to that obtained by random sampling. The sequence is demonstrated in a sampling-based motion planning algorithm.

	Abstract = {A goal of human-robot interaction is to allow one user to operate multiple robots simultaneously. In such a scenario the robots provide leverage to the user's attention. The number of such robots that can be operated is called the fan-out of a human-robot team. Robots that have high neglect tolerance and lower interaction time will achieve higher fan-out. We define an equation that relates fan-out to a robot's activity time and its interaction time. We describe how to measure activity time and fan-out. We then use the fan-out equation to compute interaction effort. We can use this interaction effort as a measure of the effectiveness of a human-robot interaction design. We describe experiments that validate the fan-out equation and its use as a metric for improving human-robot interaction.},

cover every part of the workspace, which is an essential issue in cleaning
robots and many other robotic applications such as vacuum robots,
painter robots, land mine detectors, lawn mowers, automated harvesters,
and window cleaners. In this paper, a novel neural network approach is
proposed for complete coverage path planning with obstacle avoidance
of cleaning robots in nonstationary environments. The dynamics of each
neuron in the topologically organized neural network is characterized by a
shunting equation derived from Hodgkin and Huxley's (1952) membrane
equation. There are only local lateral connections among neurons. The
robot path is autonomously generated from the dynamic activity landscape
of the neural network and the previous robot location. The proposed
model algorithm is computationally simple. Simulation results show that
the proposed model is capable of planning collision-free complete coverage
robot paths.},

	Abstract = {In this paper we introduce feedback control methods for distributed manipulation systems thatmove objects via rolling and slipping point contacts. Because of the intermittent nature of these mechanical contacts, the governing mechanics of these systems are inherently nonsmooth. We first present a methodology to model these non-smooth mechanical effects in a manner that is tractable for non-smooth   control analysis. Using these models, we show that when considerations of these non-smooth effects are taken into account, a class of traditional open-loop   distributed manipulation control methods cannot stabilize objects near an equilibrium. However, stability can be achieved through the use of feedback, and   we present non-smooth feedback laws with guaranteed stability properties. We then describe an experimental modular distributed manipulation test-bed upon which one can implement a variety of control schemes. Experiments with this test-bed confirm the validity of our control algorithms. Multimedia extensions  include videos of these experiments. },

While there exist techniques for planning motions of rigid bodies in rolling contact under nominal conditions, an inescapable challenge is the design of robust controllers of provable performance in the presence of model perturbations. As a preliminary step in this direction, we present in this paper an iterative robust planner of arbitrary accuracy for the plate-ball manipulation system subject to perturbations on the sphere radius. The basic tool is an exact geometric planner for the nominal system, whose repeated application guarantees the desired robustness property on the basis of the iterative steering paradigm. Simulation results under perturbed conditions show the effectiveness of the method.},

Abstract: In this paper, dead-reckoning error in mobile robots is studied in the context of several different models. These models are derived first in the form of stochastic differential equations (SDEs). Corresponding Fokker-Planck equations are derived, and desired probability density functions (PDFs) of robot pose are computed by using the Fourier transform for SE(2).

Abstract: This paper presents several algorithms that solve the problem of determining the orientation of a freely rotating ball that is partially enclosed in a housing. The ball is painted in two colors (black and white) and the housing has a number of sensors that detect these colors. The question which we attempt to answer is: knowing how the ball is painted, knowing the location of the sensors, and given a complete set of sensor measurements, how does one determine the orientation of the ball to within an acceptable error threshold? The algorithms we present to solve this problem are based on methods and terminology from geometric control theory. Essentially, we generate dynamical systems that evolve on the group SO(3). These dynamical systems are constructed so as to attract the computed orientation of the ball to the actual one being detected by the sensors. Solving this spherical decoding problem is important in applications where the spherical motion must be detected. One such application is the feedback control of spherical motors.

	Abstract = {Many types of omnidirectional wheels with passive rollers have gaps between rollers. Since these gaps cause a wheel to make discontinuous contact with the ground, they lead to vertical and/or horizontal vibrations during wheel operation. In addition, the radii of passive rollers are related to the height of a bump an omnidirectional wheel can surmount. In this research a new design of the alternate wheel is proposed. Because this wheel makes continuous contact with the ground and has alternating large and small rollers around the wheel, it is termed a continuous alternate wheel (CAW). In this paper a design procedure is also presented to determine the optimum number of rollers, the radii of rollers and the inside inclination angle of an outer roller for given design specifications. The CAW based on this design is compared to the existing alternate wheels in terms of design. Finally, an actual continuous alternate wheel is constructed to verify validity of the design guidelines. {\copyright}2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Abstract: An approach based on versatile nanomanipulation and assembly has been taken to investigate the fundamental properties of nanomaterials of various types for their potential applications in sensing and actuation. A nanomanipulation system with many degrees of freedom was developed for use inside a field emission scanning electron microscope. This system is capable of nanometer resolution motion, and free-space manipulation/characterization of nanostructures by the multiple probes controlled by the high precision manipulators. Specifically, the manipulation and basic construction capabilities in free space were demonstrated with nanomaterials, such as nanotubes and nanowires having diameters around tens of nanometers and length around a few microns; mechanical and electrical characterization of such individual nanoscale objects were realized with the introduction of new techniques and methods; and finally, mechanical resonance and high order parametric resonances in a nanowire mechanical system were realized using oscillating electric field induced oscillation.

Abstract: In this paper we discuss the problem of reconfiguring a sphere, rolling without slipping on a flat surface, from an arbitrary initial configuration to a desired final configuration. We propose a control algorithm that utilizes two control actions that are applied alternately. The individual control actions cause trajectories that are circular arcs and straight line segments. Through judicious choice of the sequence of individual control actions based on state feedback, we construct a control strategy that stabilizes the sphere to its desired configuration. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the strategy.

	Abstract = {We describe a framework for controlling and coordinating a group of robots for cooperative manipulation tasks. The framework enables a decentralized approach to planning and control. It allows the robots to approach the object, organize themselves into a formation that will trap the object, and then transport the object to the desired destination. Our controllers and planners are derived from simple potential fields and the hierarchical composition of potential fields. We show how these potential field based controllers and planners benefit complex group interactions, specifically for manipulating and transporting objects in the plane. Theoretically, we show how we can derive results on formation stability with potential field based controllers in many cases. Simulation results demonstrate successful application to a wide range of examples without showing sensitivity to parameters. Because the framework is decentralized at both trajectory generation level and the estimation and control agent level, our framework can potentially scale to groups of tens and hundreds of robots

	Abstract = {Many automated manufacturing processes require parts to be oriented prior to assembly. A part feeder takes in a stream of identical parts in arbitrary orientations and outputs them in uniform orientation. We consider part feeders that do not use sensing information to accomplish the task of orienting a part; these feeders include vibratory bowls, parallel jaw grippers, and conveyor belts and tilted plates with so-called fences. The input of the problem of sensorless manipulation is a description of the part shape and the output is a sequence of actions that moves the part from its unknown initial pose into a unique final pose. For each part feeder we consider, we determine classes of orientable parts, give algorithms for synthesizing sequences of actions, and derive upper bounds on the length of these sequences. },

	Abstract = {For assembly tasks parts often have to be oriented before they can be put in an assembly. The results presented in this paper are a component of the automated design of parts orienting devices. The focus is on orienting parts with minimal sensing and manipulation. We present a new approach to parts orienting through the manipulation of pose distributions. Through dynamic simulation we can determine the pose distribution for an object being dropped from an arbitrary height on an arbitrary surface. By varying the drop height and the shape of the support surface we can find the initial conditions that will result in a pose distribution with minimal entropy. We are trying to uniquely orient a part with high probability just by varying the initial conditions. We will derive a condition on the pose and velocity of a simple planar object in contact with a sloped surface that will allow us to quickly determine the final resting configuration of the object. This condition can then be used to quickly compute the pose distribution. We also present simulation and experimental results that show how dynamic simulation can be used to find optimal shapes and drop heights for a given part. },

	Abstract = {
We present a nondeterministic model of computation based on reversing edge directions in weighted directed graphs with minimum in-flow constraints on vertices. Deciding whether this simple graph model can be manipulated in order to reverse the direction of a particular edge is shown to be PSPACE-complete by a reduction from Quantified Boolean Formulas. We prove this result in a variety of special cases including planar graphs and highly restricted vertex configurations, some of which correspond to a kind of passive constraint logic. Our framework is inspired by (and indeed a generalization of) the ``Generalized Rush Hour Logic'' developed by Flake and Baum. 
We illustrate the importance of our model of computation by giving simple reductions to show that several motion-planning problems are PSPACE-hard. Our main result along these lines is that classic unrestricted sliding-block puzzles are PSPACE-hard, even if the pieces are restricted to be all dominoes (1x2 blocks) and the goal is simply to move a particular piece. No prior complexity results were known about these puzzles. This result can be seen as a strengthening of the existing result that the restricted Rush Hour puzzles are PSPACE-complete, of which we also give a simpler proof. Finally, we strengthen the existing result that the pushing-blocks puzzle Sokoban is PSPACE-complete, by showing that it is PSPACE-complete even if no barriers are allowed.

	Abstract = {In automated assembly, before parts can be put together, they often have to be appropriately oriented and positioned. The device performing this task is generally referred to as a part feeder. A new class of devices for non-prehensible distributed manipulation, such as MEMS actuator arrays, vibrating plates, etc., provides an alternative to traditional mechanical platforms for part feeding. These devices can be abstracted as programmable vector fields. Manipulation plans for these devices can therefore be considered as strategies for applying a sequence of fields to bring parts to some desired configurations. Typically, to uniquely orient and position a part, several fields have to be sequentially employed. In previous work (2001), we have shown that this objective can be accomplished using a single field. The work characterizes such a field for a given part. In this paper, we discover another interesting property of the field. In particular, we show that for a finite set of parts (with different shapes), we can specify a single field that can uniquely orient and position every part in the set. A force field device implementing this field therefore may be used as a part feeder for every part in the set without any reconfiguration.},

	Abstract = {Ant robots are simple creatures with limited sensing and computational capabilities. They have the advantage that they are easy to program and cheap to build. This makes it feasible to deploy groups of ant robots and take advantage of the resulting fault tolerance and parallelism. We study, both theoretically and in simulation, the behavior of ant robots for one-time or repeated coverage of terrain, as required for lawn mowing, mine sweeping, and surveillance. Ant robots cannot use conventional planning methods due to their limited sensing and computational capabilities. To overcome these limitations, we study navigation methods that are based on real-time (heuristic) search and leave markings in the terrain, similar to what real ants do. These markings can be sensed by all ant robots and allow them to cover terrain even if they do not communicate with each other except via the markings, do not have any kind of memory, do not know the terrain, cannot maintain maps of the terrain, nor plan complete paths. The ant robots do not even need to be localized, which completely eliminates solving difficult and time-consuming localization problems. We study two simple real-time search methods that differ only in how the markings are updated. We show experimentally that both real-time search methods robustly cover terrain even if the ant robots are moved without realizing this (say, by people running into them), some ant robots fail, and some markings get destroyed. Both real-time search methods are algorithmically similar, and our experimental results indicate that their cover time is similar in some terrains. Our analysis is therefore surprising. We show that the cover time of ant robots that use one of the real-time search methods is guaranteed to be polynomial in the number of locations, whereas the cover time of ant robots that use the other real-time search method can be exponential in (the square root of) the number of locations even in simple terrains that correspond to (planar) undirected trees.},

Underactuated manipulation allows us to build dextrous robots with only a few actuators. In this paper we explore the possibility of useful dynamic manipulation with only a single actuator. Our case study is a ball rolling in an asymmetrical bowl which can be accelerated along one linear degree-of-freedom. For a real physical system we show that it is possible to control the equilibrium orientation of the ball on the three-dimensional manifold SO(3) using the single input. We built an experimental demonstration of this system and constructed a motion planner to find a sequence of motions of the bowl to accomplish a desired reorientation},

While a human applies forces and moments, the controller guides motion by tuning the cobot's set of continuously variable transmissions. In this paper, a path-following controller is developed that steers the cobot so as to asymptotically approach and follow a preplanned path. The controller is based on feedback linearization. Generality across cobot architectures is assured by designing the controller in task space and developing transformations between each of four spaces: task space, joint space, a set of coupling spaces, and steering space},

Abstract: We develop a methodology for absolute encoding of spherical motion. This is accomplished by painting the surface of a moving sphere in two colors and sensing the color at a finite set of points. We show how point measurements on the sphere can resolve an arbitrary rotation to within a range depending on the number of sensors and the painting of the sphere. These techniques are applied to a prototype. The implementation of this prototype is discussed.

	Abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the controllability of an air hockey puck sliding on a frictionless table and subject to impacts from a mallet. This problem is a special case of the more general problem of impulsive manipulation. We first characterize the set of velocities reachable with arbitrary impulsive inputs. In reality, one cannot specify impulsive forces as inputs but rather only the velocity of a mallet impacting the puck. Therefore, we refine the characterization to the case that the impulsive forces arise through impacts with a mallet whose velocity can be arbitrarily controlled. The characterization of the reachable puck velocities then depends on the material properties of the impacting objects. We use the two-dimensional Routh impact model to determine these reachable velocities in terms of the coefficients of friction and restitution. We show that the system satisfies an accessibility-like property as long as the coefficient of friction is nonzero.},

Abstract: We describe a framework for coordinating multiple robots in cooperative manipulation tasks in which vision is used for establishing relative position and orientation and maintaining formation. The two key contributions are a cooperative scheme for localizing the robots based on visual imagery that is more robust than decentralized localization, and a set of control algorithms that allow the robots to maintain a prescribed formation (shape and size). The ability to maintain a prescribed formation allows the robots to "trap" objects in their midst, and to "flow" the formation to a desired position. We derive the cooperative localization and control algorithms and present experimental results that illustrate the implementation and the performance of these algorithms

	Abstract = {Abstract: This paper generalizes the concept of velocity obstacles given by Fiorini et al. (1998) to obstacles moving along arbitrary trajectories. We introduce the nonlinear velocity obstacle, which takes into account the shape, velocity and path curvature of the moving obstacle. The nonlinear v-obstacle allows selecting a single avoidance maneuver (if one exists) that avoids any number of obstacles moving on any known trajectories. For unknown trajectories, the nonlinear v-obstacles can be used to generate local avoidance maneuvers based on the current velocity and path curvature of the moving obstacle. This elevates the planning strategy to a second order method, compared to the first order avoidance using the linear v-obstacle, and zero order avoidance using only position information. Analytic expressions for the nonlinear v-obstacle are derived for general trajectories in the plane. The nonlinear v-obstacles are demonstrated in a complex traffic example.

	Abstract = {Programmable force fields have been used as an abstraction to represent a whole new class of devices that have been proposed for part manipulation. The general idea   behind these devices is that a force field is implemented in a plane upon which the part is placed. The forces and torques exerted on the contact surface of the part translate and rotate the part. Manipulation plans for these devices can therefore be considered as strategies for applying a sequence of force fields to bring parts to some desired configuration. Instances of these novel devices are currently implemented using microelectromechanical systems technology, small airjets,  vibration, and small motors. Manipulation in this case is sensorless and nonprehensile and promises to address the handling of very small or very fragile  parts, such as electronics components, that cannot be handled with conventional pick-and-place robotics techniques. In this paper, the authors consider the problem of bringing a part to a stable equilibrium configuration using force fields. The authors study the combination of a unit radial field with a small constant field. A part placed on the radial field moves toward the origin of the radial field but cannot be oriented due to symmetry. Perturbing the radial field with a constant force field breaks the symmetry and gives rise to a finite number of equilibria.   Under certain conditions, there is a unique stable equilibrium configuration. For the case in which these conditions are not fulfilled, the authors provide a comprehensive and unified analysis of the problem that leads to an algorithm to compute all stable equilibrium configurations. The paper contains a detailed discussion on how to implement the algorithm for any part. In the analysis, the authors make extensive use of potential fields. Using the theory of potential fields, the stable equilibrium configurations of a part are equivalent to the local minima of a scalar function. The work presented in this paper leads to the design of   a new generation of efficient, open-loop part feeders that can bring a part to a desired orientation from any initial orientation without the need of sensing or a clock.},

	Abstract = {An approach is presented for the robust stabilization of non-linear systems. The proposed strategy can be adopted whenever it is
possible to compute a control law that steers the state in "nite time from any initial condition to a point closer to the desired
equilibrium. Under suitable assumptions, such control law can be applied in an iterative fashion, obtaining uniform asymptotic
stability of the equilibrium point, with exponential rate of convergence. Small non-persistent perturbations are rejected, while
persistent perturbations induce limited errors. In order to show the usefulness of the presented theoretical developments, the approach
is applied to chained-form systems and, for illustration, simulations results are given for the robust stabilization of a unicycle.},

@article{Berretty2001,
	Abstract = {The vibratory bowl feeder is the oldest and still most common approach to the automated feeding (orienting) of industrial parts. In this paper, the authors   consider a class of vibratory bowl filters that can be described by removing polygonal sections from the track; this class of filters is referred to as traps.   For an n-sided polygonal part and an m-sided polygonal trap, an O(n2m log n) algorithm is given to decide whether the part in a specific orientation will safely   move across the trap or will fall through the trap and thus be filtered out. For an n-sided convex polygonal part and m-sided convex polygonal trap, this bound is improved to O((n+m) log n). Furthermore, the authors show how to design various trap  shapes, ranging from simple traps to general polygons, which will filter out all but one of the different stable orientations of a given part. Although the runtimes of  the design algorithms are exponential in the number of trap parameters, many industrial part feeders use few-parameter traps (balconies, canyons, slots); in these cases, the running times of the algorithms range from linear to low-degree polynomial. },

	Abstract = {Parts manufactured to tolerances have variations in shape. Most previous work in                 robotic manipulation assumes that parts do not have shape variations. Orienting                 devices such as bowl feeders often fail due to variations in part shape. We study                 the effects of uncertainty in part shape on orienting to develop systems that can                 orient toleranced polygonal parts. We present a tolerance model in which the part                 center of mass and vertices lie in circular uncertainty zones around their nominal                 positions. The variations in part shape are characterized by the tolerance model and                 the part's nominal shape. We describe the nondeterminism that arises due                 to part shape uncertainty for a conveyor-based orienting system and show that                 sensor-based and sensorless orienting plans can exist for toleranced polygonal                 parts. We present implemented planners that generate orienting plans for the entire                 variational class of part shapes given a nominal part shape and tolerance bounds.                 These plans use both deterministic and nondeterministic actions to orient the parts,                 and we describe experiments to demonstrate them.},

Abstract: Describes a prototype and analytical studies of a spherical rolling robot, a new design of a nonholonomic robot system. The spherical robot is driven by two remotely controlled, internally mounted rotors that induce the ball to roll and spin on a flat surface. It is tracked on the plane by an overhead camera. A mathematical model of the robot's motion was developed using the nonholonomic constraints on its motion. For a number of simple motions, it is shown experimentally that the model agrees well with the results. Methods were developed for planning feasible, minimum time and minimum energy trajectories for the robot. These methods are illustrated both by mathematical simulation and hardware experiments

Abstract: In the paper, constrained approximate controllability for linear dynamical systems described by abstract differential equations with unbounded control operator is considered. Using methods of spectral analysis for linear self-adjoint operators and general constrained controllability results given by Son (1990), necessary and sufficient conditions of the constrained approximate controllability for the piecewise polynomial controls with values in a given cone are formulated and proved. Moreover, as illustrative examples, constrained approximate boundary controllability of one-dimensional distributed parameter dynamical systems described by partial differential equations of parabolic type with Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions are investigated. The constrained controllability conditions obtained in the paper represent an extension of the unconstrained controllability results given by Glothin (1974) and Klamka (1991)

	Abstract = {Abstract:
We prove that two pushing-blocks puzzles are intractable in 2D. One of our constructions improves an earlier result that established intractability in 3D [OS99] for a puzzle inspired by the game PushPush. The second construction answers a question we raised in [DDO00] for a variant we call Push-1. Both puzzles consist of unit square blocks on an integer lattice; all blocks are movable. An agent may push blocks (but never pull them) in attempting to move between given start and goal positions. In the PushPush version, the agent can only push one block at a time, and moreover when a block is pushed it slides the maximal extent of its free range. In the Push-1 version, the agent can only push one block one square at a time, the minimal extent---one square. Both NP-hardness proofs are by reduction from SAT, and rely on a common construction.

	Abstract = {In this paper, we continue our investigations into robotic air hockey by studying the problem of controlling the trajectory of a puck subject to impacts. Impacts are modeled using the Routh two-dimensional impact model, which incorporates the effects of spin and friction. Using this model, we derive an explicit mapping between preimpact and postimpact velocities of the puck as a function of the velocities of the impacting objects and the coefficients of restitution and friction. We will see that this mapping depends fundamentally on whether or not relative sliding between the objects occurs throughout the duration of the impact event, or terminates during the impact. We then present results on planning of puck trajectories and control of the puck through impacts with a mallet or striker, which is essentially the problem of inverting the mapping between preimpact and postimpact velocities. Our results confirm the intuitive notion that a large coefficient of friction between the mallet and puck, and between the puck and table walls, enhances the ability to control puck motion through impacts.},

	Abstract = {Part positioning and orientation is a key issue in manufacturing. Extensive recent work has investigated a series of force fields for part positioning and orientation. Typically, a strategy that brings a part to a unique equilibrium consists of several force fields that are employed in sequence. Bohringer and Donald conjectured a few years ago that the combination of a unit radial field with a constant field would give rise to a unique equilibrium. Such a field is extremely interesting as it positions and orients parts without the need of sensing or a clock. We (2000) have proved this conjecture for nonsymmetric parts. In this paper, we focus our attention on symmetric parts and show that some of them can be uniquely positioned and oriented using the same field. Our work further explores the capabilities and limits of force fields and provides additional evidence that force fields are a powerful tool for parts manipulation.},

	Abstract = {We outline a model for types and levels of automation that provides a framework and an objective basis for deciding which system functions should be automated and to what extent. Appropriate selection is important because automation does not merely supplant but changes human activity and can impose new coordination demands on the human operator. We propose that automation can be applied to four broad classes of functions: 1) information acquisition; 2) information analysis; 3) decision and action selection; and 4) action implementation. Within each of these types, automation can be applied across a continuum of levels from low to high, i.e., from fully manual to fully automatic. A particular system can involve automation of all four types at different levels. The human performance consequences of particular types and levels of automation constitute primary evaluative criteria for automation design using our model. Secondary evaluative criteria include automation reliability and the costs of decision/action consequences, among others. Examples of recommended types and levels of automation are provided to illustrate the application of the model to automation design},

	Abstract = {Abstract. ~~ We describe a programmable apparatus that uses a vibrating surface for sensorless, nonprehensile manipulation, where parts are systematically positioned and oriented without sensor feedback or force closure. The idea is to generate and change the dynamic modes of a vibrating surface. Depending on the node shapes of the surface, the position and orientation of the parts can be predicted and constrained. The vibrating surface creates a two-dimensional force vector field. By chaining together sequences of force fields, the equilibrium states of a part in the field can be successively reduced to obtain a desired final state. We describe efficient polynomial-time algorithms that generate sequences of force fields for sensorless positioning and orienting of planar parts, and we show that these strategies are complete. Finally we consider parts feeders that can only implement a finite set of force fields. We show how to plan and execute strategies for these devices. We give numerical examples and experiments. and discuss tradeoffs between mechanical complexity and planning complexity. },

Of the collision models in use in robotics to date no one model is able to capture the richness of impulsive manipulation in impact and grasping analysis. Thus, we introduce an algebraic collision law specifically tailored to robotic interactions such as grasping. Synthesizing an algebraic collision law given in other arenas with the operational contact inertia matrix, we obtain an impulsive manipulation model which is consistent with the laws of physics and also computationally efficient. This law has potential uses in many aspects of dynamic simulation and manipulation},

My recent work is focused on nonprehensile manipulation: manipulating objects without grasping them. In particular, the paper surveys work on a single joint robot that orients parts on a conveyor belt; a robot that uses dynamics to snatch, roll, or throw objects; hitting things to position them; manipulating things whose shapes are not completely known; and integration of manipulation with locomotion. In the future, a broad view of robotics will allow us to focus on fundamental principles and at the same time address a variety of new applications.},

	Abstract = {Many of the most fundamental examples in probability involve the pose
       statistics of coins and dice as they are dropped on a flat
       surface. For these parts, the probability assigned to each
       stable face is justified based on part symmetry, although most
       gamblers are familiar with the possibility of loaded dice. In
       industrial part feeding, parts also arrive in random
       orientations. We consider the following problem: given part
       geometry and parameters such as center of mass, estimate the
       probability of encountering each stable pose of the part. We
       describe three estimators for solving this problem for
       polyhedral parts with known center of mass. The first estimator
       uses a quasistatic motion model that is computed in time O(n
       log n) for a part with n vertices. The second estimator has the
       same time complexity but takes into account a measure of
       dynamic stability based on perturbation. The third estimator
       uses repeated Monte Carlo experiments with a mechanics
       simulation package. To evaluate these estimators, we used a
       robot and computer vision system to record the pose statistics
       based on 3595 physical drop experiments with four different
       parts. We compare this data to the results from each estimator.
       We believe this is the first paper to systematically compare
       alternative estimators and to correlate their performance with
       statistically significant experiments on industrial parts},

Abstract: When a polygonal object is pushed with line contact along an edge, the push is called stable if the object remains fixed to the pusher. The object is small-time locally controllable by stable pushing if, by switching among pushing edges, it can be pushed to follow any path arbitrarily closely. Since the pushes are stable by the frictional mechanics, pushing plans can be executed without position feedback of the object. We derive a necessary and sufficient condition for a polygon to be small-time locally controllable by stable pushing: the pushing friction coefficient must be nonzero and the set of feasible pure forces (forces applied through a polygon edge and passing through the center of friction) must positively span the plane. We interpret this condition in terms of the polygon shape, the location of the center of friction, and the pushing friction coefficient, allowing us to characterize classes of polygons with this fundamental ``manoeuvrability'' property

	Abstract = {Parts orienting, the process of bringing parts in initially unknown orientations to a goal orientation, is an important aspect of automated assembly. The most common  industrial orienting systems are vibratory bowl feeders, which use the shape and mass properties of parts to orient them. Bowl feeders rely on a sequence of  mechanical operations and typically do not use sensors. In this paper, we describe the use of partial information sensors along with a sequence of pushing operations to eliminate uncertainty in the orientations of parts. We characterize the shorter execution lengths of sensor-based plans and show that sensor-based plans are more powerful than sensorless plans in that they can bring a larger class of parts to distinct orientations.  We characterize the relation among part shape, orientability, and recognizability to identify conditions under which a single plan can orient and recognize multiple part   shapes. Although part shape determines the results of the actions and the sensed information, we establish that differences in part shape do not always lead to differences in part behavior. We show that for any convex polygon, there exists an infinite set of nonsimilar convex polygons that behave identically under linear normal pushes. Furthermore, there exists an infinite set of nonsimilar convex polygons whose behavior cannot be distinguished even with diameter sensing after each push. We have implemented several planners and demonstrated generated plans in experiments. },

	Abstract = {Abstract: We consider the problem of parallel part manipulation, i.e., the simultaneous position and orientation control of one or more parts in a bounded region of the plane. We propose a novel, minimalist device, based on a single horizontally-vibrating flat plate. We show that a closed rigid motion of the plate, involving its 3 DOF, can be computed which produces desired average forces at a finite number of points, e.g., parts locations. This implies that one or more parts can follow independent trajectories simultaneously, as they interact with a single vibrating plate. This is in sharp contrast with more complex designs such as massively-parallel actuator arrays and/or prehensile manipulation. Dynamic simulation is used to test the current method in two parallel part manipulation examples. A prototype of the device has been built with inexpensive parts; physical implementation of the proposed method is currently underway

While they share many of the beneficial properties of existing randomized planning techniques, RRTs are specifically designed to handle nonholonomic constraints (including dynamics) and high degrees of freedom. An RRT is iteratively expanded by applying control inputs that drive the system slightly toward randomly-selected points, as opposed to requiring point-to-point convergence, as in the probabilistic roadmap approach. Several desirable properties and a basic implementation of RRTs are discussed. To date, we have successfully applied RRTs to holonomic, nonholonomic, and kinodynamic planning problems of up to twelve degrees of freedom.},

	Abstract = {The subject of this chapter is the control problem for nonholonomic wheeled
mobile robots moving on the plane, and in particular the use of feedback techniques
for achieving a given motion task.
In automatic control, feedback improves system performance by allowing the
successful completion of a task even in the presence of external disturbances
and/or initial errors. To this end, real-time sensor measurements are used to
reconstruct the robot state. Throughout this study, the latter is assumed to
be available at every instant, as provided by proprioceptive (e.g., odometry) or
exteroceptive (sonar, laser) sensors.
We will limit our analysis to the case of a robot workspace free of obstacles.
In fact, we implicitly consider the robot controller to be embedded in a hierarchical
architecture in which a higher-level planner solves the obstacle avoidance
problem and provides a series of motion goals to the lower control layer. In this
perspective, the controller deals with the basic issue of converting ideal plans
into actual motion execution. Wherever appropriate, we shall highlight the interactions
between feedback control and motion planning primitives, such as
the generation of open-loop commands and the availability of a feasible smooth
path joining the current robot position to the destinatio},

Underactuated mechanical systems are often subject to so-called nonholonomic constraints which are related to many both theoretical and practical issues. We first analyze the nonlinear behavior of a two-joint planar manipulator with the second joint free, from nonlinear dynamics point of view. We then discuss the simultaneous positioning of both joints. We use a time-periodic input and propose an amplitude modulation of the feedback error. The analysis via the Poincare map shows that the behavior becomes chaotic with large amplitude. The effectiveness of the proposed positioning control is verified by experiments},

@article{Donald1997,
	Abstract = {In Donald (1995), we described a manipulation task for coop erating mobile robots that can push large, heavy objects. There, we asked whether explicit local and global communication between the agents can be removed from a family of pushing protocols. In this article, we answer in the affirmative. We do so by using the general methods of Donald (1995), analyzing information invariants.
We discuss several measures for the information complexity of the task: (1) How much internal state should the robot retain? (2) How many cooperating agents are required, and how much communication between them is necessary? (3) How can the robot change (side effect) the environment to record state or sensory information for performing a task? (4) How much information is provided by sensors? and (5) How much computation is required by the robot? To answer these questions, we develop a notion of information invariants. We develop a technique whereby one sensor can be constructed from others by adding, deleting, and reallocating 1) through 5), among collaborating autonomous agents. We add a resource to measures 1) through 5) and ask: 6) How much information is provided by the task mechanics? By answering this question, we hope to develop information invariants that explicitly trade- off resource 6) with resources 1) through 5). The protocols
we describe here have been implemented in several different forms, and we report on experiments to measure and analyze information invariants using a pair of cooperating mobile robots for manipulation experiments in our laboratory.},

	Abstract = {Part manipulation is an important but also time-consuming operation in industrial automation. Recent work explores alternative solutions to the mechanical parts feeders which have been traditionally used to sort and orient parts for assembly. One of the proposed alternatives is the use of programmable vector fields. The fields are realized on a plane on which the part is placed. The forces exerted on the part{\textquoteright}s contact surface translate and rotate the part to an equilibrium orientation. Certain vector fields can be implemented in the microscale with actuator arrays and in the macroscale with transversely vibrating plates. Although current technology is still limited, the dexterity that programmable vector fields offer has prompted researchers to further explore their capabilities. This paper presents a vector field that can simultaneously orient and pose most parts into two stable equilibrium configurations. The equilibrium configurations are easily computed a priori given the part to be oriented. Our analysis makes no assumptions about the shape of the part or its connectivity except that it moves as a rigid body. The proposed vector field offers the great advantage of stability of the equilibrium configurations under small perturbations of the part which is key for the orientation of toleranced parts.},

However, this is but one component of biodiversity, and others, such as numbers of individuals or biomass, are at least as poorly known and just as important to quantify. Here, we use a variety of methods to estimate the global number of individuals for a single taxon, birds. The different methods yield surprisingly consistent estimates of a global bird population of between 200 billion and 400 billion individuals (1 billion=109). We discuss some of the implications of this figure.},

	Abstract = {Odometry is the most widely used method for determining the momentary position of a mobile robot. This paper introduces practical methods for measuring and reducing odometry errors that are caused by the two dominant error sources in differential-drive mobile robots: 1) uncertainty about the effective wheelbase; and 2) unequal wheel diameters. These errors stay almost constant over prolonged periods of time. Performing an occasional calibration as proposed here will increase the odometric accuracy of the robot and reduce operation cost because an accurate mobile robot requires fewer absolute positioning updates. Many manufacturers or end-users calibrate their robots, usually in a time-consuming and nonsystematic trial and error approach. By contrast, the method described in this paper is systematic, provides near-optimal results, and it can be performed easily and without complicated equipment. Experimental results are presented that show a consistent improvement of at least one order of magnitude in odometric accuracy (with respect to systematic errors) for a mobile robot calibrated with our method},

@phdthesis{Lynch1996,
	Abstract = {A good model of the mechanics of a task is a resource for a robot, just as actuators and
sensors are resources. The eective use of frictional, gravitational, and dynamic forces can
substitute for extra actuators; the expectation derived from a good model can minimize
sensing requirements. Despite this, most robot systems attempt to dominate or nullify
task mechanics, rather than exploit them. There has been little eort to understand the
manipulation capabilities of even the simplest robots under more complete mechanics models.
This thesis addresses that knowledge decit by studying graspless or nonprehensile
manipulation. Nonprehensile manipulation exploits task mechanics to achieve a goal
state without grasping, allowing simple mechanisms to accomplish complex tasks. With
nonprehensile manipulation, a robot can manipulate objects too large or heavy to be grasped
and lifted, and a low-degree-of-freedom robot can control more degrees-of-freedom of an
object by allowing relative motion between the object and the manipulator.
Two key problems are determining controllability of and motion planning for
nonprehensile manipulation. The rst problem is to determine whether the goal state of the
object is reachable by nonprehensile manipulation, and the second is to nd a manipulator
motion to bring the object to the goal state.
Part I studies these problems for quasistatic nonprehensile manipulation by pushing. I
elucidate the controllability properties of objects pushed with point and line contact, and
I describe a planner that nds stable pushing paths among obstacles. Pushing can also be
used to simplify the hardware of a parts feeder; a one-degree-of-freedom robot, positioned
over a conveyor, can position and orient any polygonal part on the conveyor by a series of
pushes.
Part II of the thesis studies dynamic nonprehensile manipulation. By considering
dynamics, I show that even a one-degree-of-freedom robot can take a planar object to a full
six-dimensional subset of its state space. Then I describe a planner that nds manipulator
trajectories to perform dynamic tasks such as snatching an object from a table, rolling an
object on the surface of the arm, and throwing and catching.
To demonstrate the feasibility of nonprehensile manipulation, all planners have been
implemented on },

	Abstract = {This paper is concerned with the following caging problem. One wishes to surround an object B by a multi-fingered hand such that B has some freedom to move but still cannot escape the ``cage'' formed by the fingers. The authors introduce a new notion of caging set, which is based on the configuration-space representation of the free motions of the hand-system with respect to B. Using stratified Morse theory, the authors show that the hand's configuration at which the cage is broken corresponds to a frictionless equilibrium grasp. This allows the authors to formulate a technique for computing the caging set of a 2-fingered hand whose opening is controlled by a single parameter. The technique generalizes to 1-parameter gripping systems having higher number of fingers},

	Abstract = {The existing industrial parts feeders move the parts through a
       sequence of mechanical filters that reject parts in unwanted
       orientations. In this paper we develop a new setup that uses a
       different vibratory mechanism to systematically manipulate
       parts, by actively orienting and localizing them. The idea is
       to generate and change dynamic modes for a plate by varying the
       applied frequency of oscillation. Depending on the node shapes
       of the plate for these frequencies, the position and
       orientation of the parts can be controlled. We develop an
       analysis of the underlying dynamics, and show that it can be
       used to predict the behavior of objects placed on the vibrating
       plate. Using this analysis, we propose that the applied
       frequencies can be automatically sequenced to obtain a
       ``sensorless'' strategy for manipulating a given object},

There are two parts to this problem: The inverse sliding problem, determining the velocities required to send an object to a desired configuration, and the impact problem, determining how to strike the object in order to achieve those velocities. The authors present a solution to these two problems for the class of rotationally symmetric objects and conclude with some observations about this method of manipulation},

	Abstract = {This paper introduces a method for measuring odometry errors in mobile robots and for expressing these
errors quantitatively. When measuring odometry errors, one must distinguish between (1) systematic errors,
which are caused by kinematic imperfections of the mobile robot (for example, unequal wheel-diameters),
and (2) non-systematic errors, which may be caused by wheel-slippage or irregularities of the floor.
Systematic errors are a property of the robot itself, and they stay almost constant over prolonged periods
of time, while non-systematic errors are a function of the properties of the floor.
Our method, called the University of Michigan Benchmark test (UMBmark), is especially designed to
uncover certain systematic errors that are likely to compensate for each other (and thus, remain undetected)
in less rigorous tests. This paper explains the rationale for the UMBmark procedure and explains the
procedure in detail. Experimental results from different mobile robots are also presented and discussed.
Furthermore, the paper proposes a method for measuring non-systematic errors, called extended UMBmark.
Although the measurement of non-systematic errors is less useful because it depends strongly on the floor
characteristics, one can use the extended UMBmark test for comparison of different robots under similar
conditions.},

	Abstract = {At the intersection of robotics, computational geometry, and manufacturing engineering, we have identified collection of research problems with near-term industrial applications. The common thread is robot systems with reduced intricacy in sensing and control (RISC), such as light beam sensors and parallel-jaw grippers. We conjecture that such systems, coupled with appropriate algorithms, are capable of recognizing and orienting a broad class of industrial parts. When compared with general-purpose robots, the resulting systems could be: (1) lower in cost, (2) more reliable, and (3) easier to reconfigure. The proposed hardware bears a close resemblance to existing ldquo;hard rdquo; automation; what is new is the application of computational methods for robust design and control of these systems, and more extensive use of simple sensors. By focusing on a small vocabulary of simple hardware, planning become computationally tractable and we can in some cases make guarantees about the existence of solutions. We borrowed the RISC acronym from computer architecture to acknowledge a common theme: identifying a minimal set of hardware primitives and matching these primitives with highly efficient software. In this paper, we review recent algorithms for locating, feeding, inserting and fixturing industrial parts. We discuss related work and propose a set of open problems for future research},

FISCHER, M | PSIAKI, M L
AIAA Guidance, Navigation and Control Conference, Monterey, CA; UNITED STATES; 9-11 Aug. 1993. pp. 949-957. 1993 

A design method for controllers that utilizes a Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) cost function with approximated worst-case real parameter uncertainty is developed. The method aims to reduce the sensitivity of closed-loop performance to uncertainty of real open-loop parameters. Given a performance criterion, the best controller of a given structure is designed by finding the design whose worst-case open-loop parameters yield a cost that is lower than any other controller's worst-case cost. The parameters are assumed to be constant but unknown and bounded by a hyper-ellipse. The cost function is the LQG cost function expanded in a Taylor series with respect to the uncertain parameters out to the quadratic terms. An important property of this cost function is that its global maximum with respect to parameter variations can be calculated analytically for a given controller design. A second cost function, one that depends only on controller design parameters, is defined as the maximum of the original cost function with respect to the uncertain open-loop parameters. Controller design is carried out by using nonlinear programming techniques to minimize the latter cost function with respect to the controller design parameters. The new design technique is applied to two example problems. (Author (revised)) },

	Abstract = {In this paper we make some differential-geometric observations on the kinematics of convex surfaces rolling along a fixed plane in R3, and on the relationship of the problem with parallel transport and the Gauss-Bonnet formula. These ideas are then applied to recover  Berry's phase  of a free rigid body which was found by Montgomery using Stokes' Theorem. We also point out a new  twist  on this problem. As a second application, we give a solution of a problem posed by R. Brockett. As a third application, we give a geometrical description of  Berry's phase  in SO(3); this can be applied to various rigid-elastic systems to compute their geometric phases.},

	Abstract = {This paper discusses compliant manipulation of multiple robot manipulator's cooperative in a dynamical environment. Cooperative compliant manipulation requires the simultaneous control of both the object's position and the interaction forces between the robots and the object. It is shown that position-controlled manipulators can not perform this kind of task successfully. It is proved that, in order to avoid excessive pressing, the frequency bandwidth of the overall control systems including the manipulators and the object should be adjusted according to the object dynamics. A unified model-matching control approach is developed in which each autonomous robot uses its own position and interaction force information to adjust the system's frequency bandwidth and to maintain the internal force in a desired performance. The reference models of the object's position and the internal force are selected with respect to the object's dynamics, and the force feedback controllers are designed accordingly to realize the reference models. Simulation studies show the effectiveness of this control approach},

	Abstract = {In manufacturing it is often necessary to orient parts prior to packing or assembly. We say that a planar part ispolygonal if its convex hull is a polygon. We consider the following problem: given a list ofn vertices describing a polygonal part whose initial orientation is unknown, find the shortest sequence of mechanical gripper actions that is guaranteed to orient the part up to symmetry in its convex hull. We show that such a sequence exists for any polygonal part by giving anO{$[$}n2 logn) algorithm for finding the sequence. Since the gripper actions do not require feedback, this result implies that any polygonal part can be orientedwithout sensors.},

	Abstract = {The motion of two rigid bodies under rolling constraint is considered. In particular, the following two problems are addressed: (1) given the geometry of the rigid bodies, determine the existence of an admissible path between two contact configurations; and (2) assuming that an admissible path exists, find such a path. First, the configuration space of contact is defined, and the differential equations governing the rolling constraint are derived. Then, a generalized version of Frobenius's theorem, known as Chow's theorem, for determining the existence of motion is applied. Finally, an algorithm is proposed that generates a desired path with one of the objects being flat. Potential applications of this study include adjusting grasp configurations of a multifingered robot hand without slipping, contour following without dissipation or wear by the end-effector of a manipulator, and wheeled mobile robotics},

A gray-tone image, for example, can be compared to a half-tone image having only two colors (black and white), but of higher spatial resolution. A graph-theoretical definition of the basic measure used is introduced. This is followed by application to spatial resampling and gray-level requantization. This results in a hybrid treatment of resolution, and the possibility of trading spatial for gray-level resolution and vice versa.},

@article{Erdmann1988,
	Annote = {The use of motion strategies to eliminate uncertainty, without the use of sensors, is considered. The approach is demonstrated within the context of a simple method to orient planar objects. A randomly oriented object is dropped into a tray. When the tray is tilted, the object can slide into walls, along walls, and into corners, sometimes with the effect of reducing the number of possible orientations. For some objects a sequence of tilting operations exists that leaves the object's orientation completely determined. An automatic planner is described that constructs such a tilting program, using a simple model of the mechanics of sliding. The planner has been implemented, the resulting programs have been executed using a tray attached to an industrial manipulator, and sometimes the programs work. The authors explore the issue of sensorless manipulation, tray tilting in particular, within the context of a formal framework described by T. Lozano-Perez, M.T. Mason, and Rolf Taylor (1984). It is observed that sensorless motion strategies perform conditional actions using mechanical decisions in place of environmental inquiries},

	Abstract = {The kinematics of contact describe the motion of a point of contact over the surfaces of two contacting objects in response to a relative motion of these objects. Using concepts from differential geometry, I derive a set of equations, called the contact equations, that embody this relationship. I employ the contact equations to design the following applications to be executed by an end-effector with tactile sensing capability: ( 1) determining the curvature form of an unknown object at a point of contact; and (2) following the surface of an unknown object. The contact equations also serve as a basis for an investigation of the kinematics of grasp. I derive the relation ship between the relative motion of two fingers grasping an object and the motion of the points of contact over the object surface. Based on this analysis, we explore the following applications: (1) rolling a sphere between two arbitrarily shaped fingers ; (2) fine grip adjustment ( i.e., having two fingers that grasp an unknown object locally optimize their grip for maximum stability).},

	Abstract = {Finding the relationship between two coordinate systems using pairs of measurements of the coordinates of a number of points in both systems is a classic photogrammetric task. It finds applications in stereophotogrammetry and in robotics. I present here a closed-form solution to the least-squares problem for three or more points. Currently various empirical, graphical, and numerical iterative methods are in use. Derivation of the solution is simplified by use of unit quaternions to represent rotation. I emphasize a symmetry property that a solution to this problem ought to possess. The best translational offset is the difference between the centroid of the coordinates in one system and the rotated and scaled centroid of the coordinates in the other system. The best scale is equal to the ratio of the root-mean-square deviations of the coordinates in the two systems from their respective centroids. These exact results are to be preferred to approximate methods based on measurements of a few selected points. The unit quaternion representing the best rotation is the eigenvector associated with the most positive eigenvalue of a symmetric 4x4 matrix. The elements of this matrix are combinations of sums of products of corresponding coordinates of the points.},

But this type of complex motion is rarely seen in computer animation. This paper explores an approach based on simulation as an alternative to scripting the paths of each bird individually. The simulated flock is an elaboration of a particle systems, with the simulated birds being the particles. The aggregate motion of the simulated flock is created by a distributed behavioral model much like that at work in a natural flock; the birds choose their own course. Each simulated bird is implemented as an independent actor that navigates according to its local perception of the dynamic environment, the laws of simulated physics that rule its motion, and a set of behaviors programmed into it by the "animator." The aggregate motion of the simulated flock is the result of the dense interaction of the relatively simple behaviors of the individual simulated birds.},

	Abstract = {In this paper we present a unified approach for the control of manipulator motions and active forces based on the operational space formulation. The end-effector dynamic model is used in the development of a control system in which the generalized operational space end-effector forces are selected as the command vector. This formulation provides a framework for natural and efficient integration of both end-effector force and motion control. A "generalized position and force specification matrix" is used for the specification of tasks that involve simultaneous motion and force operations. Flexibility in the force sensor, end-effector, and environment, and problems related to impact are discussed. The real-time operational space control system, COSMOS, has been recently implemented in the NYMPH multiprocessor system. Results of experiments involving contact and force step input response are presented.},

	Abstract = {A new architecture for controlling mobile robots is described. Layers of control system are built to let the robot operate at increasing levels of competence. Layers are made up of asynchronous modules that communicate over low-bandwidth channels. Each module is an instance of a fairly simple computational machine. Higher-level layers can subsume the roles of lower levels by suppressing their outputs. However, lower levels continue to function as higher levels are added. The result is a robust and flexible robot control system. The system has been used to control a mobile robot wandering around unconstrained laboratory areas and computer machine rooms. Eventually it is intended to control a robot that wanders the office areas of our laboratory, building maps of its surroundings using an onboard arm to perform simple tasks.},

which a sphere can roll from one prescribed state to another is formulated by using
quaternion calculus of variations and optimal control theory. This leads to a system

resulting expression for the curvature, it is shown that the differential equation of the
required path in intrinsic coordinates is the same as the equation of motion of a simple
pendulum, giving a solution in terms of elliptic integrals.},

	Abstract = {When two-dimensional figures, called laminae, are randomly placed on a plane domains result that can either be aggregates or individual laminae. The intersection of the union, U, of these domains with a specified field of view, F, in the plane is considered. The separate elements of the intersection are called clumps; they may be laminae, aggregates or partial laminae and aggregates. A formula is derived for the expected number of clumps minus enclosed voids. For bounded laminae homeomorphic to a closed disc with isotropic random direction the formula contains only their mean area and mean perimeter, the area and perimeter of F, and the intensity of the Poisson process.},

From two to five pearls have been produced in individual oysters in experiments carried out at Tuticorin. The rate of retention of nuclei is comparable with single implantations. While the average production with reference to the number of oysters employed is 62.8% in single implantations, it is 180.6% in multiple implantations. Besides single pearls, clusters (twins and triplet) have been obtained. The growth of pe.arls is as good in muhiple-pearl production as in singte'pearl production.},

     abstract = {At first glance the subject-matter of this paper may appear to be rather trivial. No questions of offense or defense strategies are involved; one is interested solely in calculating the probability that a point target is destroyed by one or more weapons in a salvo. If the target has an extended area, the probability of destruction is replaced by the expected fraction of the target destroyed. One might reasonably conclude that a few simple mathematical arguments involving independent random events are all that is required. However, appearances are deceptive. Since the second world war a large number of authors have dealt with problems of this type and the results of their researches are widely scattered through the mathematical literature under the general name of coverage problems. A few answers can be obtained in closed form, but the majority run into difficulties which can be overcome only by numerical integration or simulation. This paper attempts to classify these researches into a more-or-less logical pattern, emphasizing ideas and results rather than derivations. This paper is written for the engineer rather than the mathematician. Specifically, it is restricted to two-dimensional coverage problems rather than n-dimensional ones. Furthermore, little if any attention is given to that part of the literature which deals with the mathematical properties of various probability density functions useful in coverage problems. The reader interested in these details is referred to Ruben (1960). Part of the material in this survey is discussed in two excellent review articles on coverage problems by Guenther and Terragno (1964) and Guenther (1966).},

	Annote = {<br>Measurements of fruit radius and peel and pulp width, as well as determinations of fresh weight, dry weight, moisture content total and protein nitrogen content, and respiration rate were made throughout two growing seasons on Valencia oranges from the Gosford district of New South Wales. Soluble solids, sugar, and acid were also determined in the juice. Anatomical changes during development were investigated throughout one season. <br><br>Development could be divided into three stages, corresponding with changes in growth rate and coinciding on a calendar basis in both seasons. Stage I varied in length according to the date of the blossom, but was completed by mid December. This was the cell division stage; by mid December cell division was completed in all tissues except the outermost cell layers. Increase in fruit size at this stage was mainly due to increased peel thickness. Stage 11, a period of very rapid growth from mid December to mid July, was the critical period for growth and was distinguished as the cell enlargement period, rapid morphological and physiological changes occurring in the absence of cell division. The growth of the pulp was responsible for most of the increase in fruit size during Stage 11; the peel reached a maximum width early in this stage and then became thinner with very little subsequent change in thickness as the pulp continued to increase in size. Stage 111, the maturation period, lasted from mid July until the fruit was ripe, or approximately 7 months. Fruit continued to grow for as long as it was left on the tree but at a very reduced rate compared with Stage 11. Ripening occurred during Stage 111.},

	Abstract = {Rolling Ball Clocks
Rolling Ball as Oscillator, Stationary Path, Unidirectional

The critical modern study of these clocks is "The Rolling Ball Time Standard" by Prof. Hans von Bertele (1956). Prof. von Bertele's study should be read in the context of two earlier studies. One, Perpetuum Mobile: The Invention of Rolling Ball Clocks in the Seventeenth Century" by Silvio Bedini (1956) is the study which rediscovered the early history of the rolling ball clock. The other, "Precision Timekeeping in the Pre-Huygens Era" (1953) by Prof. von Bertele, does not address rolling ball clocks directly but does set the stage for von Bertele's analysis of the intellectual climate of late 16th and early 17th century Europe which produced the rolling ball clock.

16th, 17th Centuries

The earliest known reference to a clock in which a rolling ball served as the timebase dates to 1595. During the first half of the 17th century a number of examples were produced, several of which survive today (or survived until the bombings of WWII). These clocks were not (generally) novelties, but rather were serious attempts at precision timekeeping during the latter stages of the period before the introduction of the pendulum. With the arrival of the pendulum, they ceased to be relevant and disappeared from view until their rediscovery by Silvio Bedini in 1956. These clocks were not successful as improved timekeepers, but the fact that they represent a failed avenue of technological inquiry in no way diminishes their importance to the history of technology.},

The robots are almost homogeneous, but each robot has a unique parameter that scales its turning rate.  Previous work showed that such a collection of robots can be approximately steered to arbitrary Cartesian positions, but not to arbitrary heading angles in a global reference frame.  We extend this work by proving we can always steer such a collection of robots exactly to arbitrary range and bearing locations relative to targets in R^2 in a finite number of steps.  We also provide existence proofs for  controlling the final heading angles of many robots.  This work addresses a fundamental challenge in micro- and nanorobotics with possible applications in targeted therapy, sensing, and actuation. Scale hardware experiments validate the control policy.
