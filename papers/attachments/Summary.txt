Video attachment for "Crowdsourcing Swarm Manipulation Experiments: A Massive Online User Study with Large Swarms of Simple Robots" by Aaron Becker, Chris Ertel, and James McLurkin.  Video shows clips from hardware trials with over 100 robots doing manipulation experiments under human control.  These experiments are expensive in both time and equipment, so we launched SwarmControl.net to explore swarm manipulation with statistically significant number of experiments.  The results were an unexpected success, with 1000s of volunteer experimenters from across the globe. The video shows five SwarmControl.net experiments and sample results.
