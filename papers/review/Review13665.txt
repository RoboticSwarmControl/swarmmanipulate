Comments to the author
======================

Authors mention the problem of micro- nano-application in
below.

We want to use large swarms of robots to perform
manipulation tasks; unfortunately, human-swarm interaction
studies as conducted today are limited in sample size, are
difficult to reproduce, and are prone to hardware failures.
We present an alternative.

For this problem in above, the authors applied a kind of
simulation by using online game technique.

This paper examines the perils, pitfalls, and possibilities
we discovered by launching SwarmControl.net, an online game
where players steer swarms of up to 500 robots to complete
manipulation challenges. We record statistics from
thousands of players, and use the game to explore aspects
of large-population robot control.

This concept is very unique and interesting.

A task in micro- nano-robot is presented in online game.
Why do authors select the task in the online game?
Is the task important in a specific micro nano-application?
Authors should be clear the reason.

The paper mainly mentioned the careful points for user to
join the online game easily.
The discussion is important to obtain many participant.
However the careful points are one of the technique with
good online game service. This discussion is thought not to
be the essence of the concept.
Based on a real application, the task should be selected.
then, it should be shown that its result of the task
contribute to the real application.

Comments on the Video Attachment
================================

it is better for understanding to show the movie of user
interface than the animation of the result.
